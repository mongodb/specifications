<h2 id="abstract"><a class="header" href="#abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This specification outlines a new <code>timeoutMS</code> option to govern the amount of time that a single operation can execute
before control is returned to the user. This timeout applies to all of the work done to execute the operation, including
but not limited to server selection, connection checkout, and server-side execution.</p>
<h2 id="meta"><a class="header" href="#meta">META</a></h2>
<p>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</a>.</p>
<h2 id="specification"><a class="header" href="#specification">Specification</a></h2>
<h3 id="terms"><a class="header" href="#terms">Terms</a></h3>
<p><strong>min(a, b)</strong></p>
<p>Shorthand for "the minimum of a and b" where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are numeric values. For any cases where 0 means "infinite"
(e.g. <a href="#timeoutms">timeoutMS</a>), <code>min(0, other)</code> MUST evaluate to <code>other</code>.</p>
<h3 id="mongoclient-configuration"><a class="header" href="#mongoclient-configuration">MongoClient Configuration</a></h3>
<p>This specification introduces a new configuration option and deprecates some existing options.</p>
<h4 id="timeoutms"><a class="header" href="#timeoutms">timeoutMS</a></h4>
<p>This 64-bit integer option specifies the per-operation timeout value in milliseconds. The default value is unset which
means this feature is not enabled, i.e. the existing timeout behavior is unchanged (including
<code>serverSelectionTimeoutMS</code>, <code>connectTimeoutMS</code>, <code>socketTimeoutMS</code> etc..). An explicit value of 0 means infinite, though
some client-side timeouts like <code>serverSelectionTimeoutMS</code> will still apply. Drivers MUST error if a negative value is
specified. This value MUST be configurable at the level of a MongoClient, MongoDatabase, MongoCollection, or of a single
operation. However, if the option is specified at any level, it cannot be later changed to unset. At each level, the
value MUST be inherited from the previous level if it is not explicitly specified. Additionally, some entities like
<code>ClientSession</code> and <code>GridFSBucket</code> either inherit <code>timeoutMS</code> from their parent entities or provide options to override
it. The behavior for these entities is described in individual sections of this specification.</p>
<p>Drivers for languages that provide an idiomatic API for expressing durations of time (e.g. <code>TimeSpan</code> in .NET) MAY
choose to leverage these APIs for the <code>timeoutMS</code> option rather than using int64. Drivers that choose to do so MUST also
follow the semantics for special values defined by those types. Such drivers MUST also ensure that there is a way to
explicitly set <code>timeoutMS</code> to <code>infinite</code> in the API.</p>

<h4 id="backwards-breaking-considerations"><a class="header" href="#backwards-breaking-considerations">Backwards Breaking Considerations</a></h4>
<p>This specification deprecates many existing timeout options and introduces a new exception type that is used to
communicate timeout expiration. If drivers need to make backwards-breaking changes to support <code>timeoutMS</code>, the backwards
breaking behavior MUST be gated behind the presence of the <code>timeoutMS</code> option. If the <code>timeoutMS</code> option is not set,
drivers MUST continue to honor existing timeouts such as <code>socketTimeoutMS</code>. Backwards breaking changes include any
changes to exception types thrown by stable API methods or changes to timeout behavior. Drivers MUST document these
changes.</p>
<p>In a subsequent major release, drivers SHOULD drop support for legacy timeout behavior and only continue to support the
timeout options that are not deprecated by this specification. Once legacy options are removed, drivers MUST make the
backwards-breaking behavioral changes described in this specification regardless of whether or not <code>timeoutMS</code> is set by
the application.</p>
<p>See the <a href="#errors">Errors</a> section for explanations of the backwards-breaking changes to error reporting.</p>
<h4 id="deprecations"><a class="header" href="#deprecations">Deprecations</a></h4>
<p>The following configuration timeout options MUST be deprecated in favor of <code>timeoutMS</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>socketTimeoutMS</code></li>
<li><code>waitQueueTimeoutMS</code></li>
<li><code>wTimeoutMS</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The following options for CRUD methods MUST be deprecated in favor of <code>timeoutMS</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>maxTimeMS</code></li>
<li><code>maxCommitTimeMS</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timeout-behavior"><a class="header" href="#timeout-behavior">Timeout Behavior</a></h3>
<p>The <code>timeoutMS</code> option specifies the best-effort maximum amount of time a single operation can take before control is
returned to the application. Drivers MUST keep track of the remaining time before the timeout expires as an operation
progresses.</p>
<h4 id="operations"><a class="header" href="#operations">Operations</a></h4>
<p>The <code>timeoutMS</code> option applies to all operations defined in the following specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../crud/crud.html">CRUD</a></li>
<li><a href="../change-streams/change-streams.html">Change Streams</a></li>

<li><a href="../transactions/transactions.html">Transactions</a></li>
<li><a href="../transactions-convenient-api/transactions-convenient-api.html">Convenient API for Transactions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, it applies to all operations on cursor objects that may perform blocking work (e.g. methods to iterate or
close a cursor, any method that reads documents from a cursor into an array, etc).</p>
<h4 id="validation-and-overrides"><a class="header" href="#validation-and-overrides">Validation and Overrides</a></h4>
<p>When executing an operation, drivers MUST ignore any deprecated timeout options if <code>timeoutMS</code> is set on the operation
or is inherited from the collection/database/client levels. In addition to being set at these levels, the timeout for an
operation can also be expressed via an explicit ClientSession (see
<a href="#convenient-transactions-api">Convenient Transactions API</a>). In this case, the timeout on the session MUST be used as
the <code>timeoutMS</code> value for the operation. Drivers MUST raise a validation error if an explicit session with a timeout is
used and the <code>timeoutMS</code> option is set at the operation level for operations executed as part of a <code>withTransaction</code>
callback.</p>
<p>See <a href="#timeoutms-overrides-deprecated-timeout-options">timeoutMS overrides deprecated timeout options</a>.</p>
<h4 id="errors"><a class="header" href="#errors">Errors</a></h4>
<p>If the <code>timeoutMS</code> option is not set and support for deprecated timeout options has not been dropped but a timeout is
encountered (e.g. server selection times out), drivers MUST continue to return existing errors. This ensures that
error-handling code in existing applications does not break unless the user opts into using <code>timeoutMS</code>.</p>
<p>If the <code>timeoutMS</code> option is set and the timeout expires, drivers MUST abort all blocking work and return control to the
user with an error. This error MUST be distinguished in some way (e.g. custom exception type) to make it easier for
users to detect when an operation fails due to a timeout. If the timeout expires during a blocking task, drivers MUST
expose the underlying error returned from the task from this new error type. The stringified version of the new error
type MUST include the stringified version of the underlying error as a substring. For example, if server selection
expires and returns a <code>ServerSelectionTimeoutException</code>, drivers must allow users to access that exception from this new
error type. If there is no underlying error, drivers MUST add information about when the timeout expiration was detected
to the stringified version of the timeout error.</p>
<h5 id="error-transformations"><a class="header" href="#error-transformations">Error Transformations</a></h5>
<p>When using the new timeout error type, drivers MUST transform timeout errors from external sources into the new error.
One such error is the <code>MaxTimeMSExpired</code> server error. When checking for this error, drivers MUST only check that the
error code is 50 and MUST NOT check the code name or error message. This error can be present in a top-level response
document where the <code>ok</code> value is 0, as part of an error in the <code>writeErrors</code> array, or in a nested <code>writeConcernError</code>
document. For example, all three of the following server responses would match this criteria:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{ok: 0, code: 50, codeName: "MaxTimeMSExpired", errmsg: "operation time limit exceeded"}

{ok: 1, writeErrors: [{code: 50, codeName: "MaxTimeMSExpired", errmsg: "operation time limit exceeded"}]}

{ok: 1, writeConcernError: {code: 50, codeName: "MaxTimeMSExpired"}}
</code></pre>
<p>Timeouts from other sources besides MongoDB servers MUST also be transformed into this new exception type. These include
socket read/write timeouts and HTTP request timeouts.</p>
<h4 id="blocking-sections-for-operation-execution"><a class="header" href="#blocking-sections-for-operation-execution">Blocking Sections for Operation Execution</a></h4>
<p>The following pieces of operation execution are considered blocking:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implicit session acquisition if an explicit session was not provided for the operation. This is only considered
blocking for drivers that perform server selection to determine session support when acquiring implicit sessions.</li>
<li>Server selection</li>
<li>Connection checkout - If <code>maxPoolSize</code> has already been reached for the selected server, this is the amount of time
spent waiting for a connection to be available.</li>
<li>Connection establishment - If the pool for the selected server is empty and a new connection is needed, the following
pieces of connection establishment are considered blocking:
<ol>
<li>TCP socket establishment</li>
<li>TLS handshake
<ol>
<li>All messages sent over the socket as part of the TLS handshake</li>
<li>OCSP verification - HTTP requests sent to OCSP responders.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>MongoDB handshake (i.e. initial connection <code>hello</code>)</li>
<li>Authentication
<ol>
<li>SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-256, PLAIN: Execution of the command required for the SASL conversation.</li>
<li>GSSAPI: Execution of the commands required for the SASL conversation and requests to the KDC and TGS.</li>
<li>MONGODB-AWS: Execution of the commands required for the SASL conversation and all HTTP requests to ECS and EC2
endpoints.</li>
<li>MONGODB-X509: Execution of the commands required for the authentication conversation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Client-side encryption
<ol>
<li>Execution of <code>listCollections</code> commands to get collection schemas.</li>
<li>Execution of <code>find</code> commands against the key vault collection to get encrypted data keys.</li>
<li>Requests to non-local key management servers (e.g. AWS KMS) to decrypt data keys.</li>
<li>Requests to mongocryptd servers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Socket write to send a command to the server</li>
<li>Socket read to receive the server’s response</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>timeoutMS</code> option MUST apply to all blocking sections. Drivers MUST document any exceptions. For example, drivers
that do not have full control over OCSP verification might not be able to set timeouts for HTTP requests to responders
and would document that OCSP verification could result in an execution time greater than <code>timeoutMS</code>.</p>
<h4 id="server-selection"><a class="header" href="#server-selection">Server Selection</a></h4>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, drivers MUST use <code>min(serverSelectionTimeoutMS, remaining timeoutMS)</code>, referred to as
<code>computedServerSelectionTimeout</code> as the timeout for server selection and connection checkout. The server selection loop
MUST fail with a timeout error once the timeout expires.</p>
<p>After a server has been selected, drivers MUST use the remaining <code>computedServerSelectionTimeout</code> value as the timeout
for connection checkout. If a new connection is required,
<code>min(connectTimeoutMS, remaining computedServerSelectionTimeout)</code> MUST be used as the timeout for TCP socket
establishment. Any network requests required to create or authenticate a connection (e.g. HTTP requests to OCSP
responders) MUST use <code>min(operationTimeout, remaining computedServerSelectionTimeout)</code> as a timeout, where
<code>operationTimeout</code> is the specified default timeout for the network request. If there is no specified default, these
operations MUST use the remaining <code>computedServerSelectionTimeout</code> value. All commands sent during the connection’s
handshake MUST use the remaining <code>computedServerSelectionTimeout</code> as their <code>timeoutMS</code> value. Handshake commands MUST
also set timeouts per the <a href="#command-execution">Command Execution</a> section.</p>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is not set and support for <code>waitQueueTimeoutMS</code> has not been removed, drivers MUST continue to exhibit
the existing timeout behavior by honoring <code>serverSelectionTimeoutMS</code> for server selection and <code>waitQueueTimeoutMS</code> for
connection checkout. If a new connection is required, drivers MUST use <code>connectTimeoutMS</code> as the timeout for socket
establishment and <code>socketTimeoutMS</code> as the socket timeout for all handshake commands.</p>
<p>See <a href="#serverselectiontimeoutms-is-not-deprecated">serverSelectionTimeoutMS is not deprecated</a> and
<a href="#connecttimeoutms-is-not-deprecated">connectTimeoutMS is not deprecated</a>.</p>
<h4 id="command-execution"><a class="header" href="#command-execution">Command Execution</a></h4>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, drivers MUST append a <code>maxTimeMS</code> field to commands executed against a MongoDB server using the
<code>minRoundTripTime</code> field of the selected server. Note that this value MUST be retrieved during server selection using
the <code>servers</code> field of the same
<a href="../server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#TopologyDescription">TopologyDescription</a> that
was used for selection before the selected server's description can be modified. Otherwise, drivers may be subject to a
race condition where a server is reset to the default description (e.g. due to an error in the monitoring thread) after
it has been selected but before the RTT is retrieved.</p>
<p>If the <code>minRoundTripTime</code> is less than the remaining timeoutMS, the value of this field MUST be
<code>remaining timeoutMS - minRoundTripTime</code>. If not, drivers MUST return a timeout error without attempting to send the
message to the server. This is done to ensure that an operation is not routed to the server if it will likely fail with
a socket timeout as that could cause connection churn. The <code>maxTimeMS</code> field MUST be appended after all blocking work is
complete.</p>
<p>After wire message construction, drivers MUST check for timeout before writing the message to the server. If the timeout
has expired or the amount of time remaining is less than the selected server's minimum RTT, drivers MUST return the
connection to the pool and raise a timeout exception. Otherwise, drivers MUST set the connection’s write timeout to the
remaining <code>timeoutMS</code> value before writing a message to the server. After the write is complete, drivers MUST check for
timeout expiration before reading the server’s response. If the timeout has expired, the connection MUST be closed and a
timeout exception MUST be propagated to the application. If it has not, drivers MUST set the connection’s read timeout
to the remaining <code>timeoutMS</code> value. The timeout MUST apply to the aggregate of all reads done to receive a server
response, not to individual reads. If any read or write calls on the socket fail with a timeout, drivers MUST transform
the error into the new timeout exception as described in the <a href="#error-transformations">Error Transformations</a> section.</p>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is not set and support for <code>socketTimeoutMS</code> has not been removed, drivers MUST honor <code>socketTimeoutMS</code>
as the timeout for socket reads and writes.</p>
<p>See <a href="#maxtimems-accounts-for-server-rtt">maxTimeMS accounts for server RTT</a>.</p>
<h4 id="batching"><a class="header" href="#batching">Batching</a></h4>
<p>If an operation must be sent to the server in multiple batches (e.g. <code>collection.bulkWrite()</code>), the <code>timeoutMS</code> option
MUST apply to the entire operation, not to each individual batch.</p>
<h4 id="retryability"><a class="header" href="#retryability">Retryability</a></h4>
<p>If an operation requires a retry per the retryable reads or writes specifications and <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, drivers MUST
retry operations as many times as possible before the timeout expires or a retry attempt returns a non-retryable error.
Once the timeout expires, a timeout error MUST be raised.</p>
<p>See
<a href="#why-dont-drivers-use-backoffjitter-between-retry-attempts">Why don’t drivers use backoff/jitter between retry attempts?</a>.</p>
<h4 id="client-side-encryption"><a class="header" href="#client-side-encryption">Client Side Encryption</a></h4>
<p>If automatic client-side encryption or decryption is enabled, the remaining <code>timeoutMS</code> value MUST be used as the
<code>timeoutMS</code> when executing <code>listCollections</code> commands to retrieve collection schemas, <code>find</code> commands to get data from
the key vault, and any commands against mongocryptd. It MUST also be used as the request timeout for HTTP requests
against KMS servers to decrypt data keys. When sending a command to mongocryptd, drivers MUST NOT append a <code>maxTimeMS</code>
field. This is to ensure that a <code>maxTimeMS</code> field can be safely appended to the command after it has been marked by
mongocryptd and encrypted by libmongocrypt. To determine whether or not the server is a mongocryptd, drivers MUST check
that the <code>iscryptd</code> field in the server's description is <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>For explicit encryption and decryption, the <code>ClientEncryptionOpts</code> options type used to construct
<a href="../client-side-encryption/client-side-encryption.html#clientencryption">ClientEncryption</a> instances MUST support a new
<code>timeoutMS</code> option, which specifies the timeout for all operations executed on the <code>ClientEncryption</code> object.</p>
<p>See <a href="#maxtimems-is-not-added-for-mongocryptd">maxTimeMS is not added for mongocryptd</a>.</p>
<h3 id="background-connection-pooling"><a class="header" href="#background-connection-pooling">Background Connection Pooling</a></h3>
<p>Connections created as part of a connection pool’s <code>minPoolSize</code> maintenance routine MUST use <code>connectTimeoutMS</code> as the
timeout for connection establishment. After the connection is established, if <code>timeoutMS</code> is set at the MongoClient
level, it MUST be used as the timeout for all commands sent as part of the MongoDB or authentication handshakes. The
timeout MUST be refreshed after each command. These commands MUST set timeouts per the
<a href="#command-execution">Command Execution</a> section. If <code>timeoutMS</code> is not set, drivers MUST continue to honor
<code>socketTimeoutMS</code> as the socket timeout for handshake and authentication commands.</p>
<h3 id="server-monitoring"><a class="header" href="#server-monitoring">Server Monitoring</a></h3>
<p>Drivers MUST NOT use <code>timeoutMS</code> for commands executed by the server monitoring and RTT calculation threads.</p>
<p>See <a href="#monitoring-threads-do-not-use-timeoutms">Monitoring threads do not use timeoutMS</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cursors"><a class="header" href="#cursors">Cursors</a></h3>
<p>For operations that create cursors, <code>timeoutMS</code> can either cap the lifetime of the cursor or be applied separately to
the original operation and all <code>next</code> calls. To support both of these use cases, these operations MUST support a
<code>timeoutMode</code> option. This option is an enum with possible values <code>CURSOR_LIFETIME</code> and <code>ITERATION</code>. The default value
depends on the type of cursor being created. Drivers MUST error if <code>timeoutMode</code> is set and <code>timeoutMS</code> is not.</p>
<p>When applying the <code>timeoutMS</code> option to <code>next</code> calls on cursors, drivers MUST ensure it applies to the entire call, not
individual commands. For drivers that send <code>getMore</code> requests in a loop when iterating tailable cursors, the timeout
MUST apply to the totality of all <code>getMore</code>’s, not to each one individually. If a resume is required for a <code>next</code> call
on a change stream, the timeout MUST apply to the entirety of the initial <code>getMore</code> and all commands sent as part of the
resume attempt.</p>
<p>For <code>close</code> methods, drivers MUST allow <code>timeoutMS</code> to be overridden if doing so is possible in the language. If
explicitly set for the operation, it MUST be honored. Otherwise, if <code>timeoutMS</code> was applied to the operation that
created the cursor, it MUST be refreshed for the <code>killCursors</code> command if one is required. Note that this means
<code>timeoutMS</code> will be refreshed for the <code>close</code> call even if the cursor was created with a <code>timeoutMode</code> of
<code>CURSOR_LIFETIME</code> and the timeout associated with the cursor has expired. The calculated timeout MUST apply to explicit
<code>close</code> methods that can be invoked by users as well as implicit destructors that are automatically invoked when exiting
resource blocks.</p>
<p>See <a href="#cursor-close-methods-refresh-timeoutms">Cursor close() methods refresh timeoutMS</a>.</p>
<h4 id="non-tailable-cursors"><a class="header" href="#non-tailable-cursors">Non-tailable Cursors</a></h4>
<p>For non-tailable cursors, the default value of <code>timeoutMode</code> is <code>CURSOR_LIFETIME</code>. If <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, drivers MUST
apply it to the original operation and the lifetime of the created cursor. For example, if a <code>find</code> is executed at time
<code>T</code>, the <code>find</code> and all <code>getMore</code>’s on the cursor must finish by time <code>T + timeoutMS</code>. When executing <code>next</code> calls on
the cursor, drivers MUST use the remaining timeout as the <code>timeoutMS</code> value for the operation but MUST NOT append a
<code>maxTimeMS</code> field to <code>getMore</code> commands. If there are documents remaining in a previously retrieved batch, the <code>next</code>
method MUST return them even if the timeout has expired and MUST only return a timeout error if a <code>getMore</code> is required.</p>
<p>If <code>timeoutMode</code> is set to <code>ITERATION</code>, drivers MUST raise a client-side error if the operation is an <code>aggregate</code> with a
<code>$out</code> or <code>$merge</code> pipeline stage. If the operation is not an <code>aggregate</code> with <code>$out</code> or <code>$merge</code>, drivers MUST honor
the <code>timeoutMS</code> option for the initial command but MUST NOT append a <code>maxTimeMS</code> field to the command sent to the
server. After the operation has executed, the original <code>timeoutMS</code> value MUST also be applied to each <code>next</code> call on the
created cursor. Drivers MUST NOT append a <code>maxTimeMS</code> field to <code>getMore</code> commands.</p>

<h4 id="tailable-cursors"><a class="header" href="#tailable-cursors">Tailable Cursors</a></h4>
<p>Tailable cursors only support the <code>ITERATION</code> value for the <code>timeoutMode</code> option. This is the default value and drivers

<h5 id="tailable-non-awaitdata-cursors"><a class="header" href="#tailable-non-awaitdata-cursors">Tailable non-awaitData Cursors</a></h5>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, drivers MUST apply it separately to the original operation and to all <code>next</code> calls on the

<h5 id="tailable-awaitdata-cursors"><a class="header" href="#tailable-awaitdata-cursors">Tailable awaitData Cursors</a></h5>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, drivers MUST apply it to the original operation. Drivers MUST also apply the original <code>timeoutMS</code>
value to each <code>next</code> call on the resulting cursor but MUST NOT use it to derive a <code>maxTimeMS</code> value for <code>getMore</code>
commands. Helpers for operations that create tailable awaitData cursors MUST also support the <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> option.
Drivers MUST error if this option is set, <code>timeoutMS</code> is set to a non-zero value, and <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> is greater than
or equal to <code>timeoutMS</code>. If this option is set, drivers MUST use it as the <code>maxTimeMS</code> field on <code>getMore</code> commands.</p>

cursors.</p>
<h4 id="change-streams"><a class="header" href="#change-streams">Change Streams</a></h4>
<p>Driver <code>watch</code> helpers MUST support both <code>timeoutMS</code> and <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> options. Drivers MUST error if
<code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> is set, <code>timeoutMS</code> is set to a non-zero value, and <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> is greater than or equal to
<code>timeoutMS</code>. These helpers MUST NOT support the <code>timeoutMode</code> option as change streams are an abstraction around
tailable-awaitData cursors, so they implicitly use <code>ITERATION</code> mode. If set, drivers MUST apply the <code>timeoutMS</code> option
to the initial <code>aggregate</code> operation. Drivers MUST also apply the original <code>timeoutMS</code> value to each <code>next</code> call on the
change stream but MUST NOT use it to derive a <code>maxTimeMS</code> field for <code>getMore</code> commands. If the <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> option
is set, drivers MUST use it as the <code>maxTimeMS</code> field on <code>getMore</code> commands.</p>
<p>If a <code>next</code> call fails with a timeout error, drivers MUST NOT invalidate the change stream. The subsequent <code>next</code> call
MUST perform a resume attempt to establish a new change stream on the server. Any errors from the <code>aggregate</code> operation
done to create a new change stream MUST be propagated to the application. Drivers MUST document that users can either
call <code>next</code> again or close the existing change stream and create a new one if a previous <code>next</code> call times out. The
documentation MUST suggest closing and re-creating the stream with a higher timeout if the timeout occurs before any
events have been received because this is a signal that the server is timing out before it can finish processing the
existing oplog.</p>

<p>As noted in <a href="#blocking-sections-for-operation-execution">Blocking Sections for Operation Execution</a>, implicit session
checkout can be considered a blocking process for some drivers. Such drivers MUST apply the remaining <code>timeoutMS</code> value

<h4 id="convenient-transactions-api"><a class="header" href="#convenient-transactions-api">Convenient Transactions API</a></h4>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, drivers MUST apply it to the entire <code>withTransaction</code> call. To propagate the timeout to the
user-supplied callback, drivers MUST store the timeout as a field on the ClientSession object. This field SHOULD be
private to ensure that a user can not modify it while a <code>withTransaction</code> call is in progress. Drivers that cannot make
this field private MUST signal that the field should not be accessed or modified by users if there is an idiomatic way
to do so in the language (e.g. underscore-prefixed variable names in Python) and MUST document that modification of the
field can cause unintended correctness issues for applications. Drivers MUST document that the remaining timeout will
not be applied to callback operations that do not use the ClientSession. Drivers MUST also document that overriding
<code>timeoutMS</code> for operations executed using the explicit session inside the provided callback will result in a client-side
error, as defined in <a href="#validation-and-overrides">Validation and Overrides</a>. If the callback returns an error and the
transaction must be aborted, drivers MUST refresh the <code>timeoutMS</code> value for the <code>abortTransaction</code> operation.</p>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is not set, drivers MUST continue to exhibit the existing 120 second timeout behavior. Drivers MUST NOT

<h3 id="gridfs-api"><a class="header" href="#gridfs-api">GridFS API</a></h3>
<p>GridFS buckets MUST inherit <code>timeoutMS</code> from their parent MongoDatabase instance and all methods in the GridFS Bucket
API MUST support the <code>timeoutMS</code> option. For methods that create streams (e.g. <code>open_upload_stream</code>), the option MUST
cap the lifetime of the entire stream. This MUST include the time taken by any operations executed during stream
construction, reads/writes, and close/abort calls. For example, if a stream is created at time <code>T</code>, the final <code>close</code>
call on the stream MUST finish all blocking work before time <code>T + timeoutMS</code>. Methods that interact with a user-provided
stream (e.g. <code>upload_from_stream</code>) MUST use <code>timeoutMS</code> as the timeout for the entire upload/download operation. If the
user-provided streams do not support timeouts, drivers MUST document that the timeout for these methods may be breached
if calls to interact with the stream take longer than the remaining timeout. If <code>timeoutMS</code> is set, all cursors created

<h2 id="motivation-for-change"><a class="header" href="#motivation-for-change">Motivation for Change</a></h2>
<p>Users have many options to set timeouts for various parts of operation execution including, but not limited to,
<code>serverSelectionTimeoutMS</code>, <code>socketTimeoutMS</code>, <code>connectTimeoutMS</code>, <code>maxTimeMS</code>, and <code>wTimeoutMS</code>. As a result, users are
often unsure which timeout to use. Because some of these timeouts are additive, it is difficult to set a combination
which ensures control will be returned to the user after a specified amount of time. To make timeouts more intuitive,
changes are required to the drivers API to deprecate some of the existing timeouts and add a new one to specify the
maximum execution time for an entire operation from start to finish.</p>
<p>In addition, automatically retrying reads and writes that failed due to transient network blips or planned maintenance
scenarios has improved application resiliency but the original behavior of only retrying once still allowed some errors
to be propagated to applications. Supporting a timeout for an entire operation allows drivers to retry operations
multiple times while still guaranteeing that an application can get back control once the specified amount of time has
elapsed.</p>
<h2 id="design-rationale"><a class="header" href="#design-rationale">Design Rationale</a></h2>
<h3 id="timeoutms-cannot-be-changed-to-unset-once-its-specified"><a class="header" href="#timeoutms-cannot-be-changed-to-unset-once-its-specified">timeoutMS cannot be changed to unset once it's specified</a></h3>
<p>If <code>timeoutMS</code> is specified at any level, it cannot be later changed to unset at a lower level. For example, a user
cannot do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">client = MongoClient(uri, timeoutMS=1000)
db = client.database("foo", timeoutMS=None)
</code></pre>
<p>This is because drivers return existing exception types if <code>timeoutMS</code> is not specified, but will return new exception
types and use new timeout behaviors if it is. Once the user has opted into this behavior, we should not allow them to
opt out of it at a lower level. If a user wishes to set the timeout to infinite for a specific database, collection, or
operation, they can explicitly set <code>timeoutMS</code> to 0.</p>
<h3 id="serverselectiontimeoutms-is-not-deprecated"><a class="header" href="#serverselectiontimeoutms-is-not-deprecated">serverSelectionTimeoutMS is not deprecated</a></h3>
<p>The original goal of the project was to expose a single timeout and deprecate all others. This was not possible,
however, because executing an operation consists of two distinct parts. The first is selecting a server and checking out
a connection from its pool. This should have a default timeout because failure to do this indicates that the deployment
is not in a healthy state or that there was a configuration error which prevents the driver from successfully
connecting. The second is server-side operation execution, which cannot have a default timeout. Some operations finish
in a few milliseconds, while others can run for many hours. Adding a default would inevitably break applications. To
accomplish both of these goals, <code>serverSelectionTimeoutMS</code> was preserved and is used to timeout the client-side section
of operation execution.</p>
<h3 id="connecttimeoutms-is-not-deprecated"><a class="header" href="#connecttimeoutms-is-not-deprecated">connectTimeoutMS is not deprecated</a></h3>
<p>Similar to the reasoning for not deprecating <code>serverSelectionTimeoutMS</code>, socket establishment should have a default
timeout because failure to create a socket likely means that the target server is not healthy or there is a network
issue. To accomplish this, the <code>connectTimeoutMS</code> option is not deprecated by this specification. Drivers also use
<code>connectTimeoutMS</code> to derive a socket timeout for monitoring connections, which are not subject to timeoutMS.</p>
<h3 id="timeoutms-overrides-deprecated-timeout-options"><a class="header" href="#timeoutms-overrides-deprecated-timeout-options">timeoutMS overrides deprecated timeout options</a></h3>
<p>Applying both <code>timeoutMS</code> and a deprecated timeout option like <code>socketTimeoutMS</code> at the same time would lead to
confusing semantics that are difficult to document and understand. When first writing this specification, we considered
having drivers error in this situation to catch mismatched timeouts as early as possible. However, because <code>timeoutMS</code>
can be set at any level, this behavior could lead to unanticipated runtime errors if an application set <code>timeoutMS</code> for
a specific operation and the MongoClient used in production was configured with a deprecated timeout option. To have
clear semantics and avoid unexpected errors in applications, we decided that <code>timeoutMS</code> should override deprecated
timeout options.</p>
<h3 id="maxtimems-is-not-added-for-mongocryptd"><a class="header" href="#maxtimems-is-not-added-for-mongocryptd">maxTimeMS is not added for mongocryptd</a></h3>
<p>The mongocryptd server annotates the provided command to indicate encryption requirements and returns the marked up
result. If the command sent to mongocryptd contained <code>maxTimeMS</code>, the final command sent to MongoDB would contain two
<code>maxTimeMS</code> fields: one added by the regular MongoClient and another added by the mongocryptd client. To avoid this
complication, drivers do not add this field when sending commands to mongocryptd at all. Doing so does not sacrifice any
functionality because mongocryptd always runs on localhost and does not perform any blocking work, so execution or
network timeouts cannot occur.</p>
<h3 id="maxtimems-accounts-for-server-rtt"><a class="header" href="#maxtimems-accounts-for-server-rtt">maxTimeMS accounts for server RTT</a></h3>
<p>When constructing a command, drivers use the <code>timeoutMS</code> option to derive a value for the <code>maxTimeMS</code> command option and
the socket timeout. The full time to round trip a command is (network RTT + server-side execution time). If both
<code>maxTimeMS</code> and socket timeout were set to the same value, the server would never be able to respond with a
<code>MaxTimeMSExpired</code> error because drivers would hit the socket timeout first and close the connection. This would lead to
connection churn if the specified timeout is too low. To allow the server to gracefully error and avoid churn, drivers
must account for the network round trip in the <code>maxTimeMS</code> calculation.</p>
<h3 id="monitoring-threads-do-not-use-timeoutms"><a class="header" href="#monitoring-threads-do-not-use-timeoutms">Monitoring threads do not use timeoutMS</a></h3>
<p>Using <code>timeoutMS</code> in the monitoring and RTT calculation threads would require another special case in the code that
derives <code>maxTimeMS</code> from <code>timeoutMS</code> because the awaitable <code>hello</code> requests sent to 4.4+ servers already have a
<code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> field. Adding <code>maxTimeMS</code> also does not help for non-awaitable <code>hello</code> commands because we expect them
to execute quickly on the server. The Server Monitoring spec already mandates that drivers set and dynamically update
the read/write timeout of the dedicated connections used in monitoring threads, so we rely on that to time out commands
rather than adding complexity to the behavior of <code>timeoutMS</code>.</p>
<h3 id="runcommand-behavior"><a class="header" href="#runcommand-behavior">runCommand behavior</a></h3>
<p>The behavior of runCommand varies across drivers. If the provided command document includes a <code>maxTimeMS</code> field and the
<code>timeoutMS</code> option is set, some drivers would overwrite the <code>maxTimeMS</code> field with the value derived from <code>timeoutMS</code>,
while others would append a second <code>maxTimeMS</code> field, which would cause a server error on versions 3.4+. To be
prescriptive, we could mandate that drivers raise a client-side error in this case, but this would require a potentially
expensive lookup in the command document. To avoid this additional cost, drivers are only required to document the
behavior and suggest that <code>timeoutMS</code> be used instead of including a manual <code>maxTimeMS</code> field.</p>
<h3 id="why-dont-drivers-use-backoffjitter-between-retry-attempts"><a class="header" href="#why-dont-drivers-use-backoffjitter-between-retry-attempts">Why don't drivers use backoff/jitter between retry attempts?</a></h3>
<p>Earlier versions of this specification proposed adding backoff and/or jitter between retry attempts to avoid connection
storming or overloading the server, but we later deemed this unnecessary. If multiple concurrent operations select the
same server for a retry and its connection pool is empty, we rely on the <code>maxConnecting</code> parameter introduced in
DRIVERS-781 to rate limit new connection attempts, which mitigates the risk of connection storms. Even if the new server
has enough connections in its pool to service the operations, recent server versions do very little resource-intensive
work until execution reaches the storage layer, which is already guarded by read/write tickets, so we don’t expect the
server to be overwhelmed. If we later decide that adding jitter would be useful, it may be easier to do so in the server
itself via a ticket-based admission system earlier in the execution stack.</p>
<h3 id="cursor-close-methods-refresh-timeoutms"><a class="header" href="#cursor-close-methods-refresh-timeoutms">Cursor close() methods refresh timeoutMS</a></h3>
<p>If a cursor times out client-side (e.g. a non-tailable cursor created with <code>timeoutMode=CURSOR_LIFETIME</code>), it’s
imperative that drivers make a good-faith effort to close the server-side cursor even though the timeout has expired
because failing to do so would leave resources open on the server for a potentially long time. It was decided that
<code>timeoutMS</code> will be refreshed for <code>close</code> operations to allow the cursor to be killed server-side.</p>
<h3 id="non-tailable-cursor-behavior"><a class="header" href="#non-tailable-cursor-behavior">Non-tailable cursor behavior</a></h3>
<p>There are two usage patterns for non-tailable cursors. The first is to read documents from a cursor into an iterable
object, either by explicitly iterating the cursor in a loop or using a language construct like Python list
comprehensions. To supply a timeout for the entire process, drivers use <code>timeoutMS</code> to cap the execution time for the
initial command and all required <code>getMore</code>’s. This use case also matches the server behavior; if <code>maxTimeMS</code> is set for
an operation that creates a non-tailable cursor, the server will use the time limit to cap the total server-side
execution time for future <code>getMore</code>’s. Because this type of usage matches the server behavior and is the more common
case, this is the default behavior.</p>
<p>The second use case is batch processing, where the user takes advantage of the lazy nature of cursors to process
documents from a large collection. In this case, the user does not want all documents from the collection to be in an
array because that would require too much memory. To accommodate this use case, drivers support a new <code>timeoutMode</code>
option. Users can set the value for this option to <code>ITERATION</code> to have <code>timeoutMS</code> apply to the original command and
then separately to each <code>next</code> call. When this option is used, drivers do not set <code>maxTimeMS</code> on the initial command to
avoid capping the cursor lifetime in the server.</p>
<h3 id="tailable-cursor-behavior"><a class="header" href="#tailable-cursor-behavior">Tailable cursor behavior</a></h3>
<p>Once a tailable cursor is created, it conceptually lives forever. Therefore, it only makes sense to support
<code>timeoutMode=ITERATION</code> for these cursors and drivers error if <code>timeoutMode=CURSOR_LIFETIME</code> is specified.</p>
<p>There are two types of tailable cursors. The first, tailable non-awaitData cursors, support <code>maxTimeMS</code> for the original
command but not for any <code>getMore</code> requests. However, setting <code>maxTimeMS</code> on the original command also incorrectly caps
the server-side execution time for future <code>getMore</code>’s (<a href="http://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-51153">SERVER-51153</a>).
This is undesirable behavior because it does not match the guarantees made by <code>timeoutMode=ITERATION</code>. To work around
this, drivers honor <code>timeoutMS</code> for both the original operation and all <code>getMore</code>’s but only use it to derive
client-side timeouts and do not append a <code>maxTimeMS</code> field to any commands. The server-side execution time is enforced
via socket timeouts.</p>
<p>The second type is tailable awaitData cursors. The server supports the <code>maxTimeMS</code> option for the original command. For
<code>getMore</code>’s, the option is supported, but instead of limiting the server-side execution time, it specifies how long the
server should wait for new data to arrive if it reaches the end of the capped collection and the batch is still empty.
If no new data arrives within that time limit, the server will respond with an empty batch. For these cursors, drivers
support both the <code>timeoutMS</code> and <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> options. The <code>timeoutMS</code> option is used to derive client-side
timeouts, while the <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> option is used as the <code>maxTimeMS</code> field for <code>getMore</code> commands. These values have
distinct meanings, so supporting both yields a more robust, albeit verbose, API. Drivers error if <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code> is
greater than or equal to <code>timeoutMS</code> because in that case, <code>getMore</code> requests would not succeed if the batch was empty:
the server would wait for <code>maxAwaitTimeMS</code>, but the driver would close the socket after <code>timeoutMS</code>.</p>
<h3 id="change-stream-behavior"><a class="header" href="#change-stream-behavior">Change stream behavior</a></h3>
<p>Change streams internally behave as tailable awaitData cursors, so the behavior of the <code>timeoutMS</code> option is the same
for both. The main difference is that change streams are resumable and drivers automatically perform resume attempts
when they encounter transient errors. This allows change streams to be resilient to timeouts. If <code>timeoutMS</code> expires
during a next call, drivers can’t auto-resume, but they can make sure the change stream is not invalidated so the user
can call next again. In this case, the subsequent call would perform the resume without doing a <code>getMore</code> first.</p>
<h3 id="withtransaction-communicates-timeoutms-via-clientsession"><a class="header" href="#withtransaction-communicates-timeoutms-via-clientsession">withTransaction communicates timeoutMS via ClientSession</a></h3>
<p>Because the <code>withTransaction</code> API doesn’t allow drivers to plumb down the remaining timeout into the user-provided
callback, this spec requires the remaining timeout to be stored on the ClientSession. Operations in the callback that
run under that ClientSession can then extract the timeout from the session and apply it. To avoid confusing validation
semantics, operations error if there is a timeout on the session but also an overridden timeout for the operation. It’s
possible that the ability to communicate timeouts for a block of operations via a ClientSession is useful as a general
purpose API, but we’ve decided to make it private until there are other known use cases.</p>
<h3 id="withtransaction-refreshes-the-timeout-for-aborttransaction"><a class="header" href="#withtransaction-refreshes-the-timeout-for-aborttransaction">withTransaction refreshes the timeout for abortTransaction</a></h3>
<p>If the user-provided callback to <code>withTransaction</code> times out, it could leave a transaction running on the server. It’s
imperative that drivers make an effort to abort the open transaction because failing to do so could result in the
collections and databases affected by the transaction being locked for a long period of time, which could cause
applications to stall. Because <code>timeoutMS</code> has expired before drivers attempt to abort the transaction, we require
drivers to refresh it and apply the original value to the execution of the <code>abortTransaction</code> operation. This can cause
the entire <code>withTransaction</code> call to take up to <code>2*timeoutMS</code>, but it was decided that this risk is worthwhile given the
importance of transaction cleanup.</p>
<h3 id="gridfs-streams-behavior"><a class="header" href="#gridfs-streams-behavior">GridFS streams behavior</a></h3>
<p>Streams created by GridFS API operations (e.g. by <code>open_upload_stream</code> and <code>open_download_stream</code>) present a challenge
for this specification. These types of streams execute multiple operations, but there can be artificial gaps between
operations if the application does not invoke the stream functions for long periods of time. Generally, we expect users
to upload or download an entire file as quickly as possible, so we decided to have <code>timeoutMS</code> cap the lifetime of the
created stream. The other option was to apply the entire <code>timeoutMS</code> value to each operation executed by the stream, but
streams perform many hidden operations, so this approach could cause an upload/download to take much longer than
expected.</p>
<h3 id="timeoutms-cannot-be-overridden-for-startsession-calls"><a class="header" href="#timeoutms-cannot-be-overridden-for-startsession-calls">timeoutMS cannot be overridden for startSession calls</a></h3>
<p>In general, users can override <code>timeoutMS</code> at the level of a single operation. The <code>startSession</code> operation, however,
only inherits <code>timeoutMS</code> from the MongoClient and does not allow the option to be overridden. This was a conscious API
design decision because drivers are moving towards only supporting MongoDB versions 3.6 and higher, so sessions will
always be supported. Adding an override for <code>startSession</code> would introduce a new knob and increase the API surface of
drivers without providing a significant benefit.</p>
<h3 id="drivers-use-minimum-rtt-to-short-circuit-operations"><a class="header" href="#drivers-use-minimum-rtt-to-short-circuit-operations">Drivers use minimum RTT to short circuit operations</a></h3>
<p>A previous version of this spec used the 90th percentile RTT to short circuit operations that might otherwise fail with
a socket timeout. We decided to change this logic to avoid canceling operations that may have a high chance of
succeeding and also remove a dependency on t-digest. Instead, drivers use the minimum RTT from the last 10 samples, or 0
until at least 2 samples have been recorded.</p>
<h2 id="future-work"><a class="header" href="#future-work">Future work</a></h2>
<h3 id="modify-gridfs-streams-behavior-via-new-options"><a class="header" href="#modify-gridfs-streams-behavior-via-new-options">Modify GridFS streams behavior via new options</a></h3>
<p>As explained in the design rationale, drivers use <code>timeoutMS</code> to cap the entire lifetime of streams created by GridFS
operations. If we find that users are often encountering timeout errors when using these APIs due to the time spent
during non-MongoDB operations (e.g. streaming data read from a GridFS stream into another data store), we could consider
toggling GridFS behavior via an option similar to <code>timeoutMode</code> for cursors. To avoid backwards-breaking behavioral
changes, the default would continue to cap the stream lifetime but there could be another mode that refreshes the
timeout for each database operation. This would mimic using <code>timeoutMode=ITERATION</code> for cursors.</p>

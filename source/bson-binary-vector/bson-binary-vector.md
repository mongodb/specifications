# BSON Binary Subtype 9 - Vector

- Status: Pending
- Minimum Server Version: N/A

______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

This document describes the subtype of the Binary BSON type used for efficient storage and retrieval of vectors. Vectors
here refer to densely packed arrays of numbers, all of the same type.

## Motivation

These representations correspond to the numeric types supported by popular numerical libraries for vector processing,
such as NumPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow and Apache Arrow. Storing and retrieving vector data using the same densely packed
format used by these libraries can result in significant memory savings and processing efficiency.

### META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Specification

This specification introduces a new BSON binary subtype, the vector, with value `9`.

Drivers SHOULD provide idiomatic APIs to translate between arrays of numbers and this BSON Binary specification.

### Data Types (dtypes)

Each vector can take one of multiple data types (dtypes). The following table lists the dtypes implemented.

| Vector data type | Alias      | Bits per vector element | [Arrow Data Type](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/datatype.html) (for illustration) |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0x03`           | INT8       | 8                       | INT8                                                                                      |
| `0x27`           | FLOAT32    | 32                      | FLOAT                                                                                     |
| `0x10`           | PACKED_BIT | 1     `*`               | BOOL                                                                                      |

`*` A Binary Quantized (PACKED_BIT) Vector is a vector of 0s and 1s (bits), but it is represented in memory as a list of
integers in \[0, 255\]. So, for example, the vector `[0, 255]` would be shorthand for the 16-bit vector
`[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]`. The idea is that each number (a uint8) can be stored as a single byte. Of course,
some languages, Python for one, do not have an uint8 type, so must be represented as an int in memory, but not on disk.

### Byte padding

As not all data types have a bit length equal to a multiple of 8, and hence do not fit squarely into a certain number of
bytes, a second piece of metadata, the "padding" is included. This instructs the driver of the number of bits in the
final byte that are to be ignored. The least-significant bits are ignored.

### Binary structure

Following the binary subtype `9`, a two-element byte array of metadata precedes the packed numbers.

- The first byte (dtype) describes its data type. The table above shows those that MUST be implemented. This table may
  increase. dtype is an unsigned integer.

- The second byte (padding) prescribes the number of bits to ignore in the final byte of the value. It is a non-negative
  integer. It must be present, even in cases where it is not applicable, and set to zero.

- The remainder contains the actual vector elements packed according to dtype.

All values use the little-endian format.

#### Example

Let's take a vector `[238, 224]` of dtype PACKED_BIT (`\x10`) with a padding of `4`.

In hex, it looks like this: `b"\x10\x04\xee\xe0"`: 1 byte for dtype, 1 for padding, and 1 for each uint8.

We can visualize the binary representation like so:

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="8">1st byte: dtype (from list in previous table) </td>
    <td colspan="8">2nd byte: padding (values in [0,7])</td>
    <td colspan="8">1st uint8: 238</td>
    <td colspan="8">2nd uint8: 224</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Finally, after we remove the last 4 bits of padding, the actual bit vector has a length of 12 and looks like this!

| 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## API Guidance

Drivers MUST implement methods for explicit encoding and decoding that adhere to the pattern described below while
following idioms of the language of the driver.

### Encoding

```
Function from_vector(vector: Iterable<Number>, dtype: DtypeEnum, padding: Integer = 0) -> Binary
    # Converts a numeric vector into a binary representation based on the specified dtype and padding.

    # :param vector: A sequence or iterable of numbers (either float or int)
    # :param dtype: Data type for binary conversion (from DtypeEnum)
    # :param padding: Optional integer specifying how many bits to ignore in the final byte
    # :return: A binary representation of the vector

    Declare binary_data as Binary
    
    # Process each number in vector and convert according to dtype
    For each number in vector
        binary_element = convert_to_binary(number, dtype)
        binary_data.append(binary_element)
    End For
    
    # Apply padding to the binary data if needed
    If padding > 0
        apply_padding(binary_data, padding)
    End If
    
    Return binary_data
End Function
```

Note: If a driver chooses to implement a `Vector` type (or numerous) like that suggested in the Data Structure
subsection below, they MAY decide that `from_vector` that has a single argument, a Vector.

### Decoding

```
Function as_vector() -> Vector
    # Unpacks binary data (BSON or similar) into a Vector structure.
    # This process involves extracting numeric values, the data type, and padding information.

    # :return: A BinaryVector containing the unpacked numeric values, dtype, and padding.

    Declare binary_vector as BinaryVector  # Struct to hold the unpacked data

    # Extract dtype (data type) from the binary data
    binary_vector.dtype = extract_dtype_from_binary()

    # Extract padding from the binary data
    binary_vector.padding = extract_padding_from_binary()

    # Unpack the actual numeric values from the binary data according to the dtype
    binary_vector.data = unpack_numeric_values(binary_vector.dtype)

    Return binary_vector
End Function
```

#### Validation

Drivers MUST validate vector metadata and raise an error if any invariant is violated:

- Padding MUST be 0 for all dtypes where padding doesnâ€™t apply, and MUST be within \[0, 7\] for PACKED_BIT.
- A PACKED_BIT vector MUST NOT be empty if padding is in the range \[1, 7\].

Drivers MUST perform this validation when a numeric vector and padding are provided through the API, and when unpacking
binary data (BSON or similar) into a Vector structure.

#### Data Structures

Drivers MAY find the following structures to represent the dtype and vector structure useful.

```
Enum Dtype
    # Enum for data types (dtype)

    # FLOAT32: Represents packing of list of floats as float32
    # Value: 0x27 (hexadecimal byte value)

    # INT8: Represents packing of list of signed integers in the range [-128, 127] as signed int8
    # Value: 0x03 (hexadecimal byte value)

    # PACKED_BIT: Special case where vector values are 0 or 1, packed as unsigned uint8 in range [0, 255]
    # Packed into groups of 8 (a byte)
    # Value: 0x10 (hexadecimal byte value)
    
    # Documentation:
    # Each value is a byte (length of one), a convenient choice for decoding.
End Enum

Struct Vector
    # Numeric vector with metadata for binary interoperability

    # Fields:
    # data: Sequence of numeric values (either float or int)
    # dtype: Data type of vector (from enum BinaryVectorDtype)
    # padding: Number of bits to ignore in the final byte for alignment

    data     # Sequence of float or int
    dtype    # Type: DtypeEnum
    padding  # Integer: Number of padding bits
 End Struct
```

## FAQ

- What MongoDB Server version does this apply to?
  - Files in the "specifications" repository have no version scheme. They are not tied to a MongoDB server version.
- In PACKED_BIT, why would one choose to use integers in \[0, 256)?
  - This follows a well-established precedent for packing binary-valued arrays into bytes (8 bits), This technique is
    widely used across different fields, such as data compression, communication protocols, and file formats, where you
    want to store or transmit binary data more efficiently by grouping 8 bits into a single byte (uint8). For an example
    in Python, see
    [numpy.unpackbits](https://numpy.org/doc/2.0/reference/generated/numpy.unpackbits.html#numpy.unpackbits).

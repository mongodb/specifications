# MongoDB Handshake Tests

## Prose Tests

### Test 1: Test that environment metadata is properly captured

Drivers that capture values for `client.env` should test that a connection and hello command succeeds in the presence of
the following sets of environment variables:

1. Valid AWS

    | Environment Variable              | Value              |
    | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
    | `AWS_EXECUTION_ENV`               | `AWS_Lambda_java8` |
    | `AWS_REGION`                      | `us-east-2`        |
    | `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_MEMORY_SIZE` | `1024`             |

2. Valid Azure

### Test 2: Test that the driver accepts an arbitrary auth mechanism

1. Mock the server response in a way that `saslSupportedMechs` array in the `hello` command response contains an
    arbitrary string.

2. Create and connect a `Connection` object that connects to the server that returns the mocked response.

3. Assert that no error is raised.

## Client Metadata Update Prose Tests

Drivers that do not emit events for commands issued as part of the handshake with the server will need to create a
test-only backdoor mechanism to intercept the handshake `hello` command for verification purposes.

### Test 1: Test that the driver updates metadata

Drivers should verify that metadata provided after `MongoClient` initialization is appended, not replaced, and is
visible in the `hello` command of new connections.

There are multiple test cases parameterized with `DriverInfoOptions` to be appended after `MongoClient` initialization.
Before each test case, perform the setup.

#### Setup

1. Create a `MongoClient` instance with the following:

    - `maxIdleTimeMS` set to `1ms`

    - Wrapping library metadata:

        | Field    | Value            |
        | -------- | ---------------- |
        | name     | library          |
        | version  | 1.2              |
        | platform | Library Platform |

2. Send a `ping` command to the server and verify that the command succeeds.

3. Save intercepted `client` document as `initialClientMetadata`.

4. Wait 5ms for the connection to become idle.

#### Parameterized test cases

| Case | Name      | Version | Platform           |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | framework | 2.0     | Framework Platform |
| 2    | framework | 2.0     | null               |
| 3    | framework | null    | Framework Platform |
| 4    | framework | null    | null               |

#### Running a test case

1. Append the `DriverInfoOptions` from the selected test case to the `MongoClient` metadata.

2. Send a `ping` command to the server and verify:

    - The command succeeds.

    - The framework metadata is appended to the existing `DriverInfoOptions` in the `client.driver` fields of the `hello`
        command, with values separated by a pipe `|`.

        - `client.driver.name`:
            - If test case's name is non-null: `library|<name>`
            - Otherwise, the field remains unchanged: `library`
        - `client.driver.version`:
            - If test case's version is non-null: `1.2|<version>`
            - Otherwise, the field remains unchanged: `1.2`
        - `client.platform`:
            - If test case's platform is non-null: `Library Platform|<platform>`
            - Otherwise, the field remains unchanged: `Library Platform`

    - All other subfields in the `client` document remain unchanged from `initialClientMetadata`.

## Test 2: Multiple Successive Metadata Updates

Drivers should verify that after `MongoClient` initialization, metadata can be updated multiple times, not replaced, and
is visible in the `hello` command of new connections.

There are multiple test cases parameterized with `DriverInfoOptions` to be appended after a previous metadata update.
Before each test case, perform the setup.

### Setup

1. Create a `MongoClient` instance with:

    - `maxIdleTimeMS` set to `1ms`

2. Append the following `DriverInfoOptions` to the `MongoClient` metadata:

    | Field    | Value            |
    | -------- | ---------------- |
    | name     | library          |
    | version  | 1.2              |
    | platform | Library Platform |

3. Send a `ping` command to the server and verify that the command succeeds.

4. Save intercepted `client` document as `updatedClientMetadata`.

5. Wait 5ms for the connection to become idle.

#### Parameterized test cases

| Case | Name      | Version | Platform           |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | framework | 2.0     | Framework Platform |
| 2    | framework | 2.0     | null               |
| 3    | framework | null    | Framework Platform |
| 4    | framework | null    | null               |

#### Running a test case

1. Append the `DriverInfoOptions` from the selected test case to the `MongoClient` metadata.

2. Send a `ping` command to the server and verify:

    - The command succeeds.

    - The framework metadata is appended to the existing `DriverInfoOptions` in the `client.driver` fields of the `hello`
        command, with values separated by a pipe `|`.

        - `client.driver.name`:
            - If test case's name is non-null: `library|<name>`
            - Otherwise, the field remains unchanged: `library`
        - `client.driver.version`:
            - If test case's version is non-null: `1.2|<version>`
            - Otherwise, the field remains unchanged: `1.2`
        - `client.platform`:
            - If test case's platform is non-null: `Library Platform|<platform>`
            - Otherwise, the field remains unchanged: `Library Platform`

    - All other subfields in the `client` document remain unchanged from `updatedClientMetadata`.

## Test 3: Multiple Successive Metadata Updates with Duplicate Data

There are multiple test cases parameterized with `DriverInfoOptions` to be appended after a previous metadata update.
Before each test case, perform the setup.

### Setup

1. Create a `MongoClient` instance with:

    - `maxIdleTimeMS` set to `1ms`

2. Append the following `DriverInfoOptions` to the `MongoClient` metadata:

    | Field    | Value            |
    | -------- | ---------------- |
    | name     | library          |
    | version  | 1.2              |
    | platform | Library Platform |

3. Send a `ping` command to the server and verify that the command succeeds.

4. Save intercepted `client` document as `updatedClientMetadata`.

5. Wait 5ms for the connection to become idle.

#### Parameterized test cases

| Case | Name      | Version | Platform           |
| ---- | --------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | library   | 1.2     | Library Platform   |
| 2    | framework | 1.2     | Library Platform   |
| 3    | library   | 2.0     | Library Platform   |
| 4    | library   | 1.2     | Framework Platform |
| 5    | framework | 2.0     | Library Platform   |
| 6    | framework | 1.2     | Framework Platform |
| 7    | library   | 2.0     | Framework Platform |
| 8    | framework | 2.0     | Framework Platform |

#### Running a test case

1. Append the `DriverInfoOptions` from the selected test case to the `MongoClient` metadata.

2. Send a `ping` command to the server and verify:

    - The command succeeds.

    - The framework metadata is appended to the existing `DriverInfoOptions` in the `client.driver` fields of the `hello`
        command, with values separated by a pipe `|`. To simplify assertions in these tests, strip out the default driver
        info that is automatically added by the driver (ex: `metadata.name.split('|').slice(1).join('|')`).

        - If the test case's DriverInfo is identical to the driver info from setup step 2 (test case 1):
            - Assert `metadata.driver.name` is equal to `library`
            - Assert `metadata.driver.version` is equal to `1.2`
            - Assert `metadata.platform` is equal to `LibraryPlatform`
        - Otherwise:
            - Assert `metadata.driver.name` is equal to `library|<name>`
            - Assert `metadata.driver.version` is equal to `1.2|<version>`
            - Assert `metadata.platform` is equal to `LibraryPlatform|<platform>`

    - All other subfields in the `client` document remain unchanged from `updatedClientMetadata`.

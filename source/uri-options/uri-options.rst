**Abstract**
------------

Historically, URI options have been defined in individual specs, and
drivers have defined any additional options independently of one another.
Because of the frustration due to there not being a single place where
all of the URI options are defined, this spec aims to do just that—namely,
provide a canonical list of URI options that each driver defines.

**THIS SPEC DOES NOT REQUIRE DRIVERS TO MAKE ANY BREAKING CHANGES.**

**META**
--------

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
`RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.

**Specification**
-----------------

Conflicting TLS options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Per the `Connection String spec <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/connection-string/connection-string-spec.rst#repeated-keys>`_,
the behavior of duplicates of most URI options is undefined. However, due
to the security implications of certain options, drivers MUST raise an
error to the user during parsing if any of the following circumstances
occur:

1. Both ``tlsInsecure`` and ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` appear in the
   URI options.
2. Both ``tlsInsecure`` and ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`` appear in the
   URI options.
3. Both ``tlsInsecure`` and ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` appear in
   the URI options.
4. Both ``tlsInsecure`` and ``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck``
   appear in the URI options.
5. Both ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` and
   ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` appear in the URI options.
6. Both ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`` and
   ``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck`` appear in the URI options.
7. Both ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` and
   ``tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck`` appear in the URI options.
8. All instances of ``tls`` and ``ssl`` in the URI options do not have the
   same value. If all instances of ``tls`` and ``ssl`` have the same
   value, an error MUST NOT be raised.

SRV URI with directConnection URI option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver MUST report an error if the ``directConnection=true`` URI option
is specified with an SRV URI, because the URI may resolve to multiple
hosts. The driver MUST allow specifying ``directConnection=false`` URI
option with an SRV URI.

Multiple seeds with directConnection URI option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The driver MUST report an error if the ``directConnection=true`` URI option
is specified with multiple seeds.

List of specified options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each driver option below MUST be implemented in each driver unless marked
as optional. If an option is marked as optional, a driver MUST meet any
conditions specified for leaving it out if it is not included. If a driver
already provides the option under a different name, the driver MAY
implement the old and new names as aliases. All keys and values MUST be
encoded in UTF-8. All integer options are 32-bit unless specified otherwise.
Note that all requirements and recommendations described in the `Connection
String spec
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/connection-string/connection-string-spec.rst>`_
pertaining to URI options apply here.

**Test Plan**
-------------

Tests are implemented and described in the `tests <tests>`_ directory

**Design Rationale**
---------------------

Why allow drivers to provide the canonical names as aliases to existing options?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First and foremost, this spec aims not to introduce any breaking changes
to drivers. Forcing a driver to change the name of an option that it
provides will break any applications that use the old option. Moreover, it
is already possible to provide duplicate options in the URI by specifying
the same option more than once; drivers can use the same semantics to
resolve the conflicts as they did before, whether it’s raising an error,
using the first option provided, using the last option provided, or simply
telling users that the behavior is not defined.

Why use "tls" as the prefix instead of "ssl" for related options?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technically speaking, drivers already only support TLS, which supersedes
SSL. While SSL is commonly used in parlance to refer to TLS connections,
the fact remains that SSL is a weaker cryptographic protocol than TLS, and
we want to accurately reflect the strict requirements that drivers have in
ensuring the security of a TLS connection.

Why use the names "tlsAllowInvalidHostnames" and "tlsAllowInvalidCertificates"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "tls" prefix is used for the same reasons described above. The use of the
terms "AllowInvalidHostnames" and "AllowInvalidCertificates" is an intentional
choice in order to convey the inherent unsafety of these options, which should
only be used for testing purposes. Additionally, both the server and the shell
use "AllowInvalid" for their equivalent options.

Why provide multiple implementation options for the insecure TLS options (i.e. "tlsInsecure" vs. "tlsAllowInvalidHostnames"/"tlsAllowInvalidCertificates"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some TLS libraries (e.g. Go’s standard library implementation) do not provide
the ability to distinguish between allow invalid certificates and hostnames,
meaning they either both are allowed, or neither are. However, when more
granular options are available, it’s better to expose these to the user to
allow them to relax security constraints as little as they need.


Why leave the decision up to drivers to enable TLS implicitly when TLS options are present?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It can be useful to turn on TLS implicitly when options such as "tlsCAFile" are
present and "tls" is not present. However, with options such as
"tlsAllowInvalidHostnames", some drivers may not have the ability to
distinguish between "false" being provided and the option not being specified.
To keep the implicit enabling of TLS consistent between such options, we defer
the decision to enable TLS based on the presence of "tls"-prefixed options
(besides "tls" itself) to drivers.

**Reference Implementations**
-----------------------------

Ruby and Python

**Security Implication**
------------------------

Each of the "insecure" TLS options (i.e. "tlsInsecure",
"tlsAllowInvalidHostnames", "tlsAllowInvalidCertificates",
"tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck", and
"tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck") default to the more secure
option when TLS is enabled. In order to be backwards compatible with
existing driver behavior, neither TLS nor authentication is enabled by
default.

**Future Work**
---------------

This specification is intended to represent the current state of drivers URI
options rather than be a static description of the options at the time it was
written. Whenever another specification is written or modified in a way that
changes the name or the semantics of a URI option or adds a new URI option,
this specification MUST be updated to reflect those changes.

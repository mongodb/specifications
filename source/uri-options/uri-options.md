# URI Options Specification

- Status: Accepted

- Minimum Server Version: N/A

## Abstract

Historically, URI options have been defined in individual specs, and drivers have defined any additional options
independently of one another. Because of the frustration due to there not being a single place where all of the URI
options are defined, this spec aims to do just that—namely, provide a canonical list of URI options that each driver
defines.

**THIS SPEC DOES NOT REQUIRE DRIVERS TO MAKE ANY BREAKING CHANGES.**

## META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Specification

### Conflicting TLS options

Per the [Connection String spec](../connection-string/connection-string-spec.md#repeated-keys), the behavior of
duplicates of most URI options is undefined. However, due to the security implications of certain options, drivers MUST
raise an error to the user during parsing if any of the following circumstances occur:

1. Both `tlsInsecure` and `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates` appear in the URI options.
2. Both `tlsInsecure` and `tlsAllowInvalidHostnames` appear in the URI options.
3. Both `tlsInsecure` and `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck` appear in the URI options.
4. Both `tlsInsecure` and `tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck` appear in the URI options.
5. Both `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates` and `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck` appear in the URI options.
6. Both `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates` and `tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck` appear in the URI options.
7. Both `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck` and `tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck` appear in the URI options.
8. All instances of `tls` and `ssl` in the URI options do not have the same value. If all instances of `tls` and `ssl`
    have the same value, an error MUST NOT be raised.

### directConnection URI option with multiple seeds or SRV URI

The driver MUST report an error if the `directConnection=true` URI option is specified with multiple seeds.

The driver MUST report an error if the `directConnection=true` URI option is specified with an SRV URI, because the URI
may resolve to multiple hosts. The driver MUST allow specifying `directConnection=false` URI option with an SRV URI.

### srvServiceName and srvMaxHosts URI options

For URI option validation pertaining to `srvServiceName` and `srvMaxHosts`, please see the
[Initial DNS Seedlist Discovery spec](../initial-dns-seedlist-discovery/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery.md#uri-validation)
for details.

### Load Balancer Mode

For URI option validation in Load Balancer mode (i.e. `loadBalanced=true`), please see the
[Load Balancer spec](../load-balancers/load-balancers.md#uri-validation) for details.

### SOCKS5 options

For URI option validation pertaining to `proxyHost`, `proxyPort`, `proxyUsername` and `proxyPassword` please see the
[SOCKS5 support spec](../socks5-support/socks5.md#mongoclient-configuration) for details.

### List of specified options

Each driver option below MUST be implemented in each driver unless marked as optional. If an option is marked as
optional, a driver MUST meet any conditions specified for leaving it out if it is not included. If a driver already
provides the option under a different name, the driver MAY implement the old and new names as aliases. All keys and
values MUST be encoded in UTF-8. All integer options are 32-bit unless specified otherwise. Note that all requirements
and recommendations described in the [Connection String spec](../connection-string/connection-string-spec.md) pertaining
to URI options apply here.

## Test Plan

Tests are implemented and described in the [tests](tests/README.md) directory.

## Design Rationale

### Why allow drivers to provide the canonical names as aliases to existing options?

First and foremost, this spec aims not to introduce any breaking changes to drivers. Forcing a driver to change the name
of an option that it provides will break any applications that use the old option. Moreover, it is already possible to
provide duplicate options in the URI by specifying the same option more than once; drivers can use the same semantics to
resolve the conflicts as they did before, whether it's raising an error, using the first option provided, using the last
option provided, or simply telling users that the behavior is not defined.

### Why use "tls" as the prefix instead of "ssl" for related options?

Technically speaking, drivers already only support TLS, which supersedes SSL. While SSL is commonly used in parlance to
refer to TLS connections, the fact remains that SSL is a weaker cryptographic protocol than TLS, and we want to
accurately reflect the strict requirements that drivers have in ensuring the security of a TLS connection.

### Why use the names "tlsAllowInvalidHostnames" and "tlsAllowInvalidCertificates"?

The "tls" prefix is used for the same reasons described above. The use of the terms "AllowInvalidHostnames" and
"AllowInvalidCertificates" is an intentional choice in order to convey the inherent unsafety of these options, which
should only be used for testing purposes. Additionally, both the server and the shell use "AllowInvalid" for their
equivalent options.

### Why provide multiple implementation options for the insecure TLS options (i.e. "tlsInsecure" vs. "tlsAllowInvalidHostnames"/"tlsAllowInvalidCertificates"?

Some TLS libraries (e.g. Go's standard library implementation) do not provide the ability to distinguish between allow
invalid certificates and hostnames, meaning they either both are allowed, or neither are. However, when more granular
options are available, it's better to expose these to the user to allow them to relax security constraints as little as
they need.

### Why leave the decision up to drivers to enable TLS implicitly when TLS options are present?

It can be useful to turn on TLS implicitly when options such as "tlsCAFile" are present and "tls" is not present.
However, with options such as "tlsAllowInvalidHostnames", some drivers may not have the ability to distinguish between
"false" being provided and the option not being specified. To keep the implicit enabling of TLS consistent between such
options, we defer the decision to enable TLS based on the presence of "tls"-prefixed options (besides "tls" itself) to
drivers.

## Reference Implementations

Ruby and Python

## Security Implication

Each of the "insecure" TLS options (i.e. "tlsInsecure", "tlsAllowInvalidHostnames", "tlsAllowInvalidCertificates",
"tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck", and "tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck") default to the more secure option when TLS is
enabled. In order to be backwards compatible with existing driver behavior, neither TLS nor authentication is enabled by
default.

## Future Work

This specification is intended to represent the current state of drivers URI options rather than be a static description
of the options at the time it was written. Whenever another specification is written or modified in a way that changes
the name or the semantics of a URI option or adds a new URI option, this specification MUST be updated to reflect those
changes.

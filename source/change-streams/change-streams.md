# Change Streams

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 3.6

______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

As of version 3.6 of the MongoDB server a new `$changeStream` pipeline stage is supported in the aggregation framework.
Specifying this stage first in an aggregation pipeline allows users to request that notifications are sent for all
changes to a particular collection. This specification defines the means for creating change streams in drivers, as well
as behavior during failure scenarios.

## Specification

### Definitions

#### META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

#### Terms

##### Resumable Error

An error is considered resumable if it meets any of the criteria listed below. For any criteria with wire version
constraints, the driver MUST use the wire version of the connection used to do the initial `aggregate` or the `getMore`
that resulted in the error. Drivers MUST NOT check the wire version of the server after the command has been executed
when checking these constraints.

- Any error encountered which is not a server error (e.g. a timeout error or network error)

- A server error with code 43 (`CursorNotFound`)

- For servers with wire version 9 or higher (server version 4.4 or higher), any server error with the
    `ResumableChangeStreamError` error label.

- For servers with wire version less than 9, a server error with one of the following codes:

    | Error Name                      | Error Code |
    | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
    | HostUnreachable                 | 6          |
    | HostNotFound                    | 7          |
    | NetworkTimeout                  | 89         |
    | ShutdownInProgress              | 91         |
    | PrimarySteppedDown              | 189        |
    | ExceededTimeLimit               | 262        |
    | SocketException                 | 9001       |
    | NotWritablePrimary              | 10107      |
    | InterruptedAtShutdown           | 11600      |
    | InterruptedDueToReplStateChange | 11602      |
    | NotPrimaryNoSecondaryOk         | 13435      |
    | NotPrimaryOrSecondary           | 13436      |
    | StaleShardVersion               | 63         |
    | StaleEpoch                      | 150        |
    | StaleConfig                     | 13388      |
    | RetryChangeStream               | 234        |
    | FailedToSatisfyReadPreference   | 133        |

An error on an aggregate command is not a resumable error. Only errors on a getMore command may be considered resumable
errors.

### Guidance

For naming and deviation guidance, see the [CRUD specification](../crud/crud.md#naming).

### Server Specification

#### Response Format

**NOTE:** The examples in this section are provided for illustrative purposes, and are subject to change without
warning. Drivers that provide a static type to represent ChangeStreamDocument MAY include additional fields in their
API.

If an aggregate command with a `$changeStream` stage completes successfully, the response contains documents with the
following structure:

   * change stream.

   * @note: The server will add new `operationType` values in the future and drivers
   * MUST NOT err when they encounter a new `operationType`. Unknown `operationType`
   * values may be represented by "unknown" or the literal string value.

**NOTE:** The set of `ChangeStreamOptions` may grow over time.

#### Helper Method

The driver API consists of a `ChangeStream` type, as well as three helper methods. All helpers MUST return a
`ChangeStream` instance. Implementers MUST document that helper methods are preferred to running a raw aggregation with
a `$changeStream` stage, for the purpose of supporting resumability.

The helper methods must construct an aggregation command with a REQUIRED initial `$changeStream` stage. A driver MUST
NOT throw a custom exception if multiple `$changeStream` stages are present (e.g. if a user also passed `$changeStream`
in the pipeline supplied to the helper), as the server will return an error.

The helper methods MUST determine a read concern for the operation in accordance with the
[Read and Write Concern specification](../read-write-concern/read-write-concern.md#via-code). The initial implementation
of change streams on the server requires a 'majority' read concern or no read concern. Drivers MUST document this
requirement. Drivers SHALL NOT throw an exception if any other read concern is specified, but instead should depend on
the server to return an error.

The stage has the following shape:

```typescript
{ $changeStream: ChangeStreamOptions }
```

The first parameter of the helpers specifies an array of aggregation pipeline stages which MUST be appended to the
initial stage. Drivers MUST support an empty pipeline. Languages which support default parameters MAY specify an empty
array as the default value for this parameter. Drivers SHOULD otherwise make specification of a pipeline as similar as
possible to the [aggregate](../crud/crud.md#read) CRUD method.

Additionally, implementers MAY provide a form of these methods which require no parameters, assuming no options and no
additional stages beyond the initial `$changeStream` stage:

```python
for change in db.collection.watch():
    print(change)
```

Presently change streams support only a subset of available aggregation stages:

- `$match`
- `$project`
- `$addFields`
- `$replaceRoot`
- `$redact`

A driver MUST NOT throw an exception if any unsupported stage is provided, but instead depend on the server to return an
error.

A driver MUST NOT throw an exception if a user adds, removes, or modifies fields using `$project`. The server will
produce an error if `_id` is projected out, but a user should otherwise be able to modify the shape of the change stream
event as desired. This may require the result to be deserialized to a `BsonDocument` or custom-defined type rather than
a `ChangeStreamDocument`. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the deserialized type is compatible with
the specified `$project` stage.

The aggregate helper methods MUST have no new logic related to the `$changeStream` stage. Drivers MUST be capable of
handling [TAILABLE_AWAIT](../crud/crud.md#read) cursors from the aggregate command in the same way they handle such
cursors from find.

##### `Collection.watch` helper

Returns a `ChangeStream` on a specific collection

Command syntax:

```typescript
{
  aggregate: 'collectionName'
  pipeline: [{$changeStream: {...}}, ...],
  ...
}
```

##### `Database.watch` helper

- Since: 4.0

Returns a `ChangeStream` on all collections in a database.

Command syntax:

```typescript
{
  aggregate: 1
  pipeline: [{$changeStream: {...}}, ...],
  ...
}
```

Drivers MUST use the `ns` returned in the `aggregate` command to set the `collection` option in subsequent `getMore`
commands.

##### `MongoClient.watch` helper

- Since: 4.0

Returns a `ChangeStream` on all collections in all databases in a cluster

Command syntax:

```typescript
{
  aggregate: 1
  pipeline: [{$changeStream: {allChangesForCluster: true, ...}}, ...],
  ...
}
```

The helper MUST run the command against the `admin` database

Drivers MUST use the `ns` returned in the `aggregate` command to set the `collection` option in subsequent `getMore`
commands.

#### ChangeStream

A `ChangeStream` is an abstraction of a [TAILABLE_AWAIT](../crud/crud.md#read) cursor, with support for resumability.
Implementers MAY choose to implement a `ChangeStream` as an extension of an existing tailable cursor implementation. If
the `ChangeStream` is implemented as a type which owns a tailable cursor, then the implementer MUST provide a manner of
closing the change stream, as well as satisfy the requirements of extending `Iterable<Document>`. If your language has
an idiomatic way of disposing of resources you MAY choose to implement that in addition to, or instead of, an explicit
close method.

A change stream MUST track the last resume token, per
[Updating the Cached Resume Token](#updating-the-cached-resume-token).

Drivers MUST raise an error on the first document received without a resume token (e.g. the user has removed `_id` with
a pipeline stage), and close the change stream. The error message SHOULD resemble "Cannot provide resume functionality
when the resume token is missing".

A change stream MUST attempt to resume a single time if it encounters any resumable error per
[Resumable Error](#resumable-error). A change stream MUST NOT attempt to resume on any other type of error.

In addition to tracking a resume token, change streams MUST also track the read preference specified when the change
stream was created. In the event of a resumable error, a change stream MUST perform server selection with the original
read preference using the
[rules for server selection](../server-selection/server-selection.md#rules-for-server-selection) before attempting to
resume.

##### Single Server Topologies

Presently, change streams cannot be initiated on single server topologies as they do not have an oplog. Drivers MUST NOT
throw an exception in this scenario, but instead rely on an error returned from the server. This allows for the server
to seamlessly introduce support for this in the future, without need to make changes in driver code.

##### startAtOperationTime

- Since: 4.0

`startAtOperationTime` specifies that a change stream will only return changes that occurred at or after the specified
`Timestamp`.

The server expects `startAtOperationTime` as a BSON Timestamp. Drivers MUST allow users to specify a
`startAtOperationTime` option in the `watch` helpers. They MUST allow users to specify this value as a raw `Timestamp`.

`startAtOperationTime`, `resumeAfter`, and `startAfter` are all mutually exclusive; if any two are set, the server will
return an error. Drivers MUST NOT throw a custom error, and MUST defer to the server error.

The `ChangeStream` MUST save the `operationTime` from the initial `aggregate` response when the following criteria are
met:

- None of `startAtOperationTime`, `resumeAfter`, `startAfter` were specified in the `ChangeStreamOptions`.
- The max wire version is >= `7`.
- The initial `aggregate` response had no results.
- The initial `aggregate` response did not include a `postBatchResumeToken`.

##### resumeAfter

`resumeAfter` is used to resume a `ChangeStream` that has been stopped to ensure that only changes starting with the log
entry immediately *after* the provided token will be returned. If the resume token specified does not exist, the server
will return an error.

##### Resume Process

Once a `ChangeStream` has encountered a resumable error, it MUST attempt to resume one time. The process for resuming
MUST follow these steps:

- Perform server selection.
- Connect to selected server.
- If there is a cached `resumeToken`:
    - If the `ChangeStream` was started with `startAfter` and has yet to return a result document:
        - The driver MUST set `startAfter` to the cached `resumeToken`.
        - The driver MUST NOT set `resumeAfter`.
        - The driver MUST NOT set `startAtOperationTime`. If `startAtOperationTime` was in the original aggregation command,
            the driver MUST remove it.
    - Else:
        - The driver MUST set `resumeAfter` to the cached `resumeToken`.
        - The driver MUST NOT set `startAfter`. If `startAfter` was in the original aggregation command, the driver MUST
            remove it.
        - The driver MUST NOT set `startAtOperationTime`. If `startAtOperationTime` was in the original aggregation command,
            the driver MUST remove it.
- Else if there is no cached `resumeToken` and the `ChangeStream` has a saved operation time (either from an originally
    specified `startAtOperationTime` or saved from the original aggregation) and the max wire version is >= `7`:
    - The driver MUST NOT set `resumeAfter`.
    - The driver MUST NOT set `startAfter`.
    - The driver MUST set `startAtOperationTime` to the value of the originally used `startAtOperationTime` or the one
        saved from the original aggregation.
- Else:
    - The driver MUST NOT set `resumeAfter`, `startAfter`, or `startAtOperationTime`.
    - The driver MUST use the original aggregation command to resume.

When `resumeAfter` is specified the `ChangeStream` will return notifications starting with the oplog entry immediately
*after* the provided token.

If the server supports sessions, the resume attempt MUST use the same session as the previous attempt's command.

A driver MUST only attempt to resume once from a resumable error. However, if the `aggregate` for that resume succeeds,
a driver MUST ensure that following resume attempts can succeed, even in the absence of any changes received by the
cursor between resume attempts. For example:

1. `aggregate` (succeeds)
2. `getMore` (fails with resumable error)
3. `aggregate` (succeeds)
4. `getMore` (fails with resumable error)
5. `aggregate` (succeeds)
6. `getMore` (succeeds)
7. change stream document received

A driver SHOULD attempt to kill the cursor on the server on which the cursor is opened during the resume process, and
MUST NOT attempt to kill the cursor on any other server. Any exceptions or errors that occur during the process of
killing the cursor should be suppressed, including both errors returned by the `killCursor` command and exceptions
thrown by opening, writing to, or reading from the socket.

##### Exposing All Resume Tokens

- Since: 4.0.7

Users can inspect the \_id on each `ChangeDocument` to use as a resume token. But since MongoDB 4.0.7, aggregate and
getMore responses also include a `postBatchResumeToken`. Drivers use one or the other when automatically resuming, as
described in [Resume Process](#resume-process).

Drivers MUST expose a mechanism to retrieve the same resume token that would be used to automatically resume. It MUST be
possible to use this mechanism after iterating every document. It MUST be possible for users to use this mechanism
periodically even when no documents are getting returned (i.e. `getMore` has returned empty batches). Drivers have two
options to implement this.

###### Option 1: ChangeStream::getResumeToken()

```typescript
interface ChangeStream extends Iterable<Document> {
  /**
   * Returns the cached resume token that will be used to resume
   * after the most recently returned change.
   */
  public getResumeToken() Optional<Document>;
}
```

This MUST be implemented in synchronous drivers. This MAY be implemented in asynchronous drivers.

###### Option 2: Event Emitted for Resume Token

Allow users to set a callback to listen for new resume tokens. The exact interface is up to the driver, but it MUST meet
the following criteria:

- The callback is set in the same manner as a callback used for receiving change documents.
- The callback accepts a resume token as an argument.
- The callback (or event) MAY include an optional ChangeDocument, which is unset when called with resume tokens sourced
    from `postBatchResumeToken`.

A possible interface for this callback MAY look like:

```typescript
interface ChangeStream extends Iterable<Document> {
  /**
   * Returns a resume token that should be used to resume after the most
   * recently returned change.
   */
  public onResumeTokenChanged(ResumeTokenCallback:(Document resumeToken) => void);
}
```

This MUST NOT be implemented in synchronous drivers. This MAY be implemented in asynchronous drivers.

###### Updating the Cached Resume Token

The following rules describe how to update the cached `resumeToken`:

- When the `ChangeStream` is started:
    - If `startAfter` is set, cache it.
    - Else if `resumeAfter` is set, cache it.
    - Else, `resumeToken` remains unset.
- When `aggregate` or `getMore` returns:
    - If an empty batch was returned and a `postBatchResumeToken` was included, cache it.
- When returning a document to the user:
    - If it's the last document in the batch and a `postBatchResumeToken` is included, cache it.
    - Else, cache the `_id` of the document.

###### Not Blocking on Iteration

Synchronous drivers MUST provide a way to iterate a change stream without blocking until a change document is returned.
This MUST give the user an opportunity to get the most up-to-date resume token, even when the change stream continues to
receive empty batches in getMore responses. This allows users to call `ChangeStream::getResumeToken()` after iterating
every document and periodically when no documents are getting returned.

Although the implementation of tailable awaitData cursors is not specified, this MAY be implemented with a `tryNext`
method on the change stream cursor.

All drivers MUST document how users can iterate a change stream and receive *all* resume token updates.
[Why do we allow access to the resume token to users](#why-do-we-allow-access-to-the-resume-token-to-users) shows an
example. The documentation MUST state that users intending to store the resume token should use this method to get the
most up to date resume token.

##### Timeouts

Drivers MUST apply timeouts to change stream establishment, iteration, and resume attempts per
[Client Side Operations Timeout: Change Streams](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md#change-streams).

##### Notes and Restrictions

**1. `fullDocument: updateLookup` can result in change documents larger than 16 MiB**

There is a risk that if there is a large change to a large document, the full document and delta might result in a
document larger than the 16 MiB limitation on BSON documents. If that happens the cursor will be closed, and a server
error will be returned.

**2. Users can remove the resume token with aggregation stages**

It is possible for a user to specify the following stage:

```javascript
{ $project: { _id: 0 } }
```

Similar removal of the resume token is possible with the `$redact` and `$replaceRoot` stages. While this is not
technically illegal, it makes it impossible for drivers to support resumability. Users may explicitly opt out of
resumability by issuing a raw aggregation with a `$changeStream` stage.

## Rationale

### Why Helper Methods?

Change streams are a first class concept similar to CRUD or aggregation; the fact that they are initiated via an
aggregation pipeline stage is merely an implementation detail. By requiring drivers to support top-level helper methods
for this feature we not only signal this intent, but also solve a number of other potential problems:

Disambiguation of the result type of this special-case aggregation pipeline (`ChangeStream`), and an ability to control
the behaviors of the resultant cursor

More accurate support for the concept of a maximum time the user is willing to wait for subsequent queries to complete
on the resultant cursor (`maxAwaitTimeMs`)

Finer control over the options pertaining specifically to this type of operation, without polluting the already
well-defined `AggregateOptions`

Flexibility for future potentially breaking changes for this feature on the server

### Why are ChangeStreams required to retry once on a resumable error?

User experience is of the utmost importance. Errors not originating from the server are generally network errors, and
network errors can be transient. Attempting to resume an interrupted change stream after the initial error allows for a
seamless experience for the user, while subsequent network errors are likely to be an outage which can then be exposed
to the user with greater confidence.

### Why do we allow access to the resume token to users

Imagine a scenario in which a user wants to process each change to a collection **at least once**, but the application
crashes during processing. In order to overcome this failure, a user might use the following approach:

```python
localChange = getChangeFromLocalStorage()
resumeToken = getResumeTokenFromLocalStorage()

if localChange:
  processChange(localChange)

try:
    change_stream = db.collection.watch([...], resumeAfter=resumeToken)
    while True:
        change = change_stream.try_next()
        persistResumeTokenToLocalStorage(change_stream.get_resume_token())
        if change:
          persistChangeToLocalStorage(change)
          processChange(change)
except Exception:
    log.error("...")
```

In this case the current change is always persisted locally, including the resume token, such that on restart the
application can still process the change while ensuring that the change stream continues from the right logical time in
the oplog. It is the application's responsibility to ensure that `processChange` is idempotent, this design merely makes
a reasonable effort to process each change **at least** once.

### Why is there no example of the desired user experience?

The specification used to include this overspecified example of the "desired user experience":

```python
try:
    for change in db.collection.watch(...):
        print(change)
except Exception:
    # We know for sure it's unrecoverable:
    log.error("...")
```

It was decided to remove this example from the specification for the following reasons:

- Tailable + awaitData cursors behave differently in existing supported drivers.
- There are considerations to be made for languages that do not permit interruptible I/O (such as Java), where a change
    stream which blocks forever in a separate thread would necessitate killing the thread.
- There is something to be said for an API that allows cooperation by default. The model in which a call to next only
    blocks until any response is returned (even an empty batch), allows for interruption and cooperation (e.g.
    interaction with other event loops).

### Why is an allow list of error codes preferable to a deny list?

Change streams originally used a deny list of error codes to determine which errors were not resumable. However, this
allowed for the possibility of infinite resume loops if an error was not correctly deny listed. Due to the fact that all
errors aside from transient issues such as failovers are not resumable, the resume behavior was changed to use an allow
list. Part of this change was to introduce the `ResumableChangeStreamError` label so the server can add new error codes
to the allow list without requiring changes to drivers.

### Why is `CursorNotFound` special-cased when determining resumability?

With the exception of `CursorNotFound`, a server error on version 4.4 or higher is considered resumable if and only if
it contains the `ResumableChangeStreamError` label. However, this label is only added by the server if the cursor being
created or iterated is a change stream. `CursorNotFound` is returned when a `getMore` is done with a cursor ID that the
server isn't aware of and therefore can't determine if the cursor is a change stream. Marking all `CursorNotFound`
errors resumable in the server regardless of cursor type could be confusing as a user could see the
`ResumableChangeStreamError` label when iterating a non-change stream cursor. To workaround this, drivers always treat
this error as resumable despite it not having the proper error label.

### Why do we need to send a default `startAtOperationTime` when resuming a `ChangeStream`?

`startAtOperationTime` allows a user to create a resumable change stream even when a result (and corresponding
resumeToken) is not available until a later point in time.

For example:

- A client creates a `ChangeStream`, and calls `watch`
- The `ChangeStream` sends out the initial `aggregate` call, and receives a response with no initial values. Because
    there are no initial values, there is no latest resumeToken.
- The client's network is partitioned from the server, causing the client's `getMore` to time out
- Changes occur on the server.
- The network is unpartitioned
- The client attempts to resume the `ChangeStream`

In the above example, not sending `startAtOperationTime` will result in the change stream missing the changes that
occurred while the server and client are partitioned. By sending `startAtOperationTime`, the server will know to include
changes from that previous point in time.

### Why do we need to expose the postBatchResumeToken?

Resume tokens refer to an oplog entry. The resume token from the `_id` of a document corresponds the oplog entry of the
change. The `postBatchResumeToken` represents the oplog entry the change stream has scanned up to on the server (not
necessarily a matching change). This can be a much more recent oplog entry, and should be used to resume when possible.

Attempting to resume with an old resume token may degrade server performance since the server needs to scan through more
oplog entries. Worse, if the resume token is older than the last oplog entry stored on the server, then resuming is
impossible.

Imagine the change stream matches a very small percentage of events. On a `getMore` the server scans the oplog for the
duration of `maxAwaitTimeMS` but finds no matching entries and returns an empty response (still containing a
`postBatchResumeToken`). There may be a long sequence of empty responses. Then due to a network error, the change stream
tries resuming. If we tried resuming with the most recent `_id`, this throws out the oplog scanning the server had done
for the long sequence of getMores with empty responses. But resuming with the last `postBatchResumeToken` skips the
unnecessary scanning of unmatched oplog entries.

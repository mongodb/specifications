Abstract
========

The SDAM monitoring specification defines a set of behaviour in the drivers for providing runtime information about server discovery and monitoring events (SDAM) to any 3rd party library as well internal driver use, such as logging.

-----------
Definitions
-----------

META
----

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.

Terms
-----

``ServerAddress``

  The term ``ServerAddress`` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of a server host/port pair. This may be an object or a string. The name of this object is NOT REQUIRED.

``TopologyType``

  The term ``TopologyType`` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of a topology type (standalone, sharded, etc.). This may be a string or object. The name of the object is NOT REQUIRED.

``Server``

  The term ``Server`` refers to the implementation in the driver’s language of either an abstraction of a connection to a single mongod or mongos process, as defined by the `SDAM specification <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst#server>`_.

-------------
Specification
-------------

Events
------
This specification defines 9 main events that MUST be published in the scenarios described. 6 of these events are the core behaviour within the cluster lifecycle, and the remaining 3 server heartbeat events are fired from the server monitor and follow the guidelines for publishing in the command monitoring specification.

Events that MUST be published (with their conditions) are as follows.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Event Type
     - Condition


   * - ``TopologyOpeningEvent``
     - When a topology description is initialized - this MUST be the first SDAM event fired.
   * - ``ServerOpeningEvent``
     - Published when the server description is instantiated with its defaults, and MUST be the first operation to happen after the defaults are set. This is before the Monitor is created and the Monitor socket connection is opened.
   * - ``ServerDescriptionChangedEvent``
     - When the old server description is not equal to the new server description
   * - ``TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent``
     - When the old topology description is not equal to the new topology description.
   * - ``ServerClosedEvent``
     - Published when the server monitor’s connection is closed and the server is shutdown.
   * - ``TopologyClosedEvent``
     - When a topology is shut down - this MUST be the last SDAM event fired.
    * - ``ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent``
      - Published when the server monitor sends its ismaster call to the server.
    * - ``ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent``
       - Published on successful completion of the server monitor’s ismaster call.
    * - ``ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent``
      - Published on failure of the server monitor’s ismaster call, either with an ok: 0 result or a socket exception from the connection.


Operations
----------
All drivers MUST implement the API. Implementation details are noted in the comments when a specific implementation is required. Within each API, all methods are REQUIRED unless noted otherwise in the comments.

Naming
------
All drivers MUST name operations, parameters and topic names as defined in the following sections. Exceptions to this rule are noted in the appropriate section. Class and interface names may vary according to the driver and language best practices.

Documentation
-------------
The documentation provided in code below is merely for driver authors and SHOULD NOT be taken as required documentation for the driver.

--------
Guidance
--------

Publishing and Subscribing
--------------------------

The driver SHOULD publish events in a manner that is standard to the driver's language publish/subscribe patterns and is not strictly mandated in this specification.

----------
Guarantees
----------

Event Order and Concurrency
---------------------------

Events MUST be published in the order they were applied in the driver.
Events MUST NOT be published concurrently for the same topology id or server id, but MAY be published concurrently for differing topology ids and server ids.

Heartbeats
----------

The driver MUST guarantee that every ServerHearbeatStartedEvent has either a correlating ServerHearbeatSucceededEvent or ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent.

Error Handling
--------------

If an exception occurs while sending the ismaster operation to the server, the driver MUST generate a ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent with the exception or message and re-raise the exception. The SDAM mandated retry of the ismaster call should be visible to consumers.

Topology Ids
------------

These MUST be a unique value that is specific to the Topology in which the events are fired. The language may decide how to generate the value and what type the value is, as long as it is unique to the Topology. The id MUST be created once when the Topology is created and remain the same until the Topology is destroyed.

Topology Description
--------------------

The TopologyDescription object MUST expose the new methods defined in the API below, in order for subscribers to take action on certain conditions based on the driver options.

TopologyDescription objects MAY have additional methods and properties.

Initial Server Description
--------------------------

ServerDescriptions MUST be initialized with a default description in an “unknown” state, guaranteeing that the previous description in the events will never be null.

Determining If A Topology Has Readable/Writable Servers
-------------------------------------------------------

The following table describes the behaviour of determining if a topology type has readable or
writable servers. If no read preference is passed to ``hasReadableServer``, the driver MUST default
the value to the default read preference, ``primary``, or treat the call as if ``primary`` was provided.

+-----------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+
| Topology Type         | ``hasReadableServer``                  | ``hasWritableServer``                  |

|                       |   any server in the cluster is         |                                        |
|                       |   suitable for reading.                |                                        |
|                       | | Called with no option: ``false``     |                                        |

|                       |   the read preference to determine if  |                                        |
|                       |   any server in the cluster is         |                                        |
|                       |   suitable for reading.                |                                        |
|                       | | Called with no option: ``true``      |                                        |

+-----------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------------------------------+

--------
Examples
--------

A Ruby subscriber to topology description changed events that logs the events.

Ruby:

.. code:: ruby

  class TopologyDescriptionChangedSubscriber

    def completed(event)
      new_description = event.new_description
      if (!new_description.has_writable_server?)
        LOGGER.warn('New topology description contains no writable server.')
      end
    end
  end

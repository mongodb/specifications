# SDAM Logging and Monitoring Specification

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 2.4

______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

The SDAM logging and monitoring specification defines a set of behaviors in the driver for providing runtime information
about server discovery and monitoring (SDAM) in log messages, as well as in events that users can consume
programmatically, either directly or by integrating with third-party APM libraries.

### Definitions

#### META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

#### Terms

`ServerAddress`

> The term `ServerAddress` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of a server host/port pair. This may be
> an object or a string. The name of this object is NOT REQUIRED.

`TopologyType`

> The term `TopologyType` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of a topology type (standalone, sharded,
> etc.). This may be a string or object. The name of the object is NOT REQUIRED.

`Server`

> The term `Server` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of an abstraction of a mongod or mongos
> process, or a load balancer, as defined by the [SDAM specification](server-discovery-and-monitoring.md#server).

### Specification

### Guidance

#### Documentation

The documentation provided in the code below is merely for driver authors and SHOULD NOT be taken as required
documentation for the driver.

#### Messages and Events

All drivers MUST implement the specified event types as well as log messages.

Implementation details are noted below when a specific implementation is required. Within each event and log message,
all properties are REQUIRED unless noted otherwise.

#### Naming

All drivers MUST name types, properties, and log message values as defined in the following sections. Exceptions to this
rule are noted in the appropriate section. Class and interface names may vary according to the driver and language best
practices.

#### Publishing and Subscribing

The driver SHOULD publish events in a manner that is standard to the driver's language publish/subscribe patterns and is
not strictly mandated in this specification.

Similarly, as described in the [logging specification](../logging/logging.md#implementation-requirements) the driver
SHOULD emit log messages in a manner that is standard for the language.

### Guarantees

#### Event Order and Concurrency

Events and log messages MUST be published in the order that their corresponding changes are processed in the driver.
Events MUST NOT be published concurrently for the same topology ID or server ID, but MAY be published concurrently for
differing topology IDs and server IDs.

#### Heartbeats

The driver MUST guarantee that every `ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent` has either a correlating
`ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent` or `ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent`, and that every "server heartbeat started" log message
has either a correlating "server heartbeat succeeded" or "server heartbeat failed" log message.

Drivers that use the streaming heartbeat protocol MUST publish a `ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent` and "server heartbeat
started" log message before attempting to read the next `hello` or legacy hello exhaust response.

#### Error Handling

If an exception occurs while sending the `hello` or legacy hello operation to the server, the driver MUST generate a
`ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent` and "server heartbeat failed" log message with the exception or message and re-raise the
exception. The SDAM mandated retry of the `hello` or legacy hello call should be visible to consumers.

#### Topology IDs

These MUST be a unique value that is specific to the Topology for which the events and log messages are emitted. The
language may decide how to generate the value and what type the value is, as long as it is unique to the Topology. The
ID MUST be created once when the Topology is created and remain the same until the Topology is destroyed.

#### Initial Server Description

`ServerDescription` objects MUST be initialized with a default description in an "unknown" state, guaranteeing that the
previous description in the events and log messages will never be null.

#### Initial Topology Description

The first `TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent` to be emitted from a monitored Topology MUST set its `previousDescription`
property to be a `TopologyDescription` object in the "unknown" state.

### Events API

The first `TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent` to be emitted from a monitored Topology MUST set its `previousDescription`
property to be a `TopologyDescription` object in the "unknown" state.

## Closing Topology Description

When a `Topology` object or equivalent is being shut-down or closed, the driver MUST change the `TopologyDescription` to
an "unknown" state.

______________________________________________________________________

## Events API

This specification defines 9 main events that MUST be published in the scenarios described. 6 of these events are the
core behaviour within the cluster lifecycle, and the remaining 3 server heartbeat events are fired from the server
monitor and follow the guidelines for publishing in the command monitoring specification.

Events that MUST be published (with their conditions) are as follows.

| Event Type                        | Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TopologyOpeningEvent`            | When a topology description is initialized - this MUST be the first SDAM event fired.                                                                                                                                             |
| `ServerOpeningEvent`              | Published when the server description is instantiated with its defaults, and MUST be the first operation to happen after the defaults are set. This is before the Monitor is created and the Monitor socket connection is opened. |
| `ServerDescriptionChangedEvent`   | When the old server description is not equal to the new server description                                                                                                                                                        |
| `TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent` | When the old topology description is not equal to the new topology description.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `ServerClosedEvent`               | Published when the server monitor's connection is closed and the server is shutdown.                                                                                                                                              |
| `TopologyClosedEvent`             | When a topology is shut down - this MUST be the last SDAM event fired.                                                                                                                                                            |
| `ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent`     | Published when the server monitor sends its `hello` or legacy hello call to the server. When the monitor is creating a new connection, this event MUST be published just before the socket is created.                            |
| `ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent`   | Published on successful completion of the server monitor's `hello` or legacy hello call.                                                                                                                                          |
| `ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent`      | Published on failure of the server monitor's `hello` or legacy hello call, either with an ok: 0 result or a socket exception from the connection.                                                                                 |

```

The `TopologyDescription` object MUST expose the new methods defined in the API below, in order for subscribers to take
action on certain conditions based on the driver options.

`TopologyDescription` objects MAY have additional methods and properties.

```typescript
/**
 * Describes the current topology.
 */
interface TopologyDescription {

  /**
   * Determines if the topology has a readable server available. See the table in the
   * following section for behaviour rules.
   */
  hasReadableServer(readPreference: Optional<ReadPreference>): Boolean

  /**
   * Determines if the topology has a writable server available. See the table in the
   * following section for behaviour rules.
   */
  hasWritableServer(): Boolean
}
```

### Determining If A Topology Has Readable/Writable Servers

The following table describes the rules for determining if a topology type has readable or writable servers. If no read
preference is passed to `hasReadableServer`, the driver MUST default the value to the default read preference,
`primary`, or treat the call as if `primary` was provided.

| Topology Type         | `hasReadableServer`                                                                                                                                                                               | `hasWritableServer`                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unknown               | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                           | `false`                            |
| Single                | `true` if the server is available                                                                                                                                                                 | `true` if the server is available  |
| ReplicaSetNoPrimary   | Called with `primary`: `false`  <br>Called with any other option: uses the read preference to determine if any server in the cluster is suitable for reading.  <br>Called with no option: `false` | `false`                            |
| ReplicaSetWithPrimary | Called with any valid option: uses the read preference to determine if any server in the cluster is suitable for reading.  <br>Called with no option: `true`                                      | `true`                             |
| Sharded               | `true` if 1+ servers are available                                                                                                                                                                | `true` if 1+ servers are available |
| LoadBalanced          | `true`                                                                                                                                                                                            | `true`                             |

### Log Messages

Please refer to the [logging specification](../logging/logging.md) for details on logging implementations in general,
including log levels, log components, and structured versus unstructured logging.

Drivers MUST support logging of SDAM information via the following types of log messages. These messages MUST be logged
at `Debug` level and use the `topology` log component.

A number of the log messages are intended to match the information contained in the events above. However, note that a
log message regarding a server description change (which would correspond to `ServerDescriptionChangedEvent`) has been
intentionally omitted since the information it would contain is redundant with `TopologyDescriptionChangedEvent` and the
equivalent log message.

Drivers MAY implement SDAM logging support via an event subscriber if it is convenient to do so.

The types used in the structured message definitions below are demonstrative, and drivers MAY use similar types instead
so long as the information is present (e.g. a double instead of an integer, or a string instead of an integer if the
structured logging framework does not support numeric types.)

#### Common Fields

The following key-value pairs are common to all or several log messages and MUST be included in the "applicable
messages":

| Key                | Applicable Messages                                                                | Suggested Type | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

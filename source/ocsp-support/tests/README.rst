OCSP Support Test Plan
======================

.. contents::

----------

Introduction
=============

The prose tests defined in this file are platform-independent tests that
drivers can use to prove their conformance to the OCSP Support
specification. These tests MUST BE implemented by all drivers.

Additional YAML and JSON tests have also been added to the `URI
Options Tests <../../uri-options/tests/README.rst>`__.  Specifically,
the `TLS Options Test <../../uri-options/test/tls-options.yml>`__ has
been updated with additional tests for the new URI options
``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`` and ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck.

Tests involving the new URI options MUST BE implemented by drivers
that are able to support those new URI options (see `MongoClient
Configuration <../ocsp-support#MongoClient-Configuration>`__).

Testing Invalid Configurations
==============================

The following tests only apply to drivers that expose an option to
enable/disable certificate revocation checking on a per MongoClient
basis.

1. Create a MongoClient with ``tlsInsecure=true``.

2. Enable certificate revocation checking on the MongoClient.

3. Ensure that an error is thrown noting that revocation checking cannot
   be used in combination with ``tlsInsecure=true``.

The following test only applies to drivers that expose an option to
enable/disable certificate revocation checking on a per MongoClient
basis and implement support for ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates``.

1. Create a MongoClient with ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=true``.

2. Enable certificate revocation checking on the MongoClient

3. Ensure that an error is thrown noting that revocation checking cannot
   be used in combination with ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=true``.

Integration Tests: Permutations to Be Tested
============================================

For integration tests, we will test all combinations of URI options that
influence a driver’s OCSP behavior with both validity states of the
server’s certificate (configured with the mock OCSP responder). We will
also test the case where an OCSP responder is unavailable and two
malicious server cases.

See
`Required Server Versions <../ocsp-support.rst#required-server-versions>`__
to determine which versions of the server can be used for each column.

Note: From the perspective of a driver that does not support OCSP
stapling, the following sets of tests should be identical: {Test 1, Test
3}, {Test 2, Test 4, Malicious Server Test 1}, and {Soft Fail Test,
Malicious Server Test 2}. For drivers with full control over their OCSP behavior, both malicious
server tests are identical as well. However, it does no harm to test these
extra cases and may help reveal unexpected behavior.

\*: Drivers that cannot pass these tests due to limitations in their TLS
library’s implementation of OCSP will need to document these failures as
described under `Documentation
Requirements <../ocsp-support.rst#documentation-requirements>`__

Mock OCSP Responder Testing Suite
==================================

The certificates and scripts needed for testing OCSP are part of
`driver-evergreen-tools
<https://github.com/mongodb-labs/drivers-evergreen-tools>`__ in
``.evergreen/ocsp``.  The ``rsa`` and ``ecdsa`` directories contain
the certificates and scripts needed to test with RSA and ECDSA
certificates, respectively.

Both of the above directories contain four scripts: ``mock-valid.sh``,
``mock-revoked.sh``, ``mock-delegate-valid.sh``, and
``mock-delegate-revoked.sh``.

``mock-valid.sh`` starts up a mock OCSP responder that uses the
issuing CA's certificate. This responder will report that every
certificate is valid.

``mock-revoked.sh`` starts up a mock OCSP responder that uses the
issuing CA's certificate. This responder will report that every
certificate is revoked.

``mock-delegate-valid-valid.sh`` starts up a mock OCSP responder that
uses a delegate certificate. This responder will report that every
certificate is valid.

``mock-delegate-revoked.sh`` starts up a mock OCSP that uses a
delegate certificate. This responder will report that every
certificate is revoked.

mongo-orchestration configurations
----------------------------------

The mongo-orchestration configurations needed for testing can be found
at ``.evergreen/orchestration/configs/servers/``.

RSA Tests
^^^^^^^^^^

Tests that specify that a server should staple MUST use
``rsa-basic-tls-ocsp-mustStaple.json``. Tests that specify that a
server should not staple MUST use
``rsa-basic-tls-ocsp-disableStapling.json``. The malicious server
tests MUST use ``rsa-basic-tls-ocsp-mustStaple-disableStapling.json``.

ECDSA Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tests that specify that a server should staple MUST use
``ecdsa-basic-tls-ocsp-mustStaple.json``. Tests that specify that a
server should not staple MUST use
``ecdsa-basic-tls-ocsp-disableStapling.json``. The malicious server
tests MUST use
``ecdsa-basic-tls-ocsp-mustStaple-disableStapling.json``.

Test Procedure
==============

Each column that utilizes an OCSP responder represents four tests:

1. A test with RSA certificates and an OCSP responder that uses the
   issuing CA's certificate
2. A test with RSA certificates and an OCSP responder that uses a
   delegate certificate
3. A test with ECDSA certificates and an OCSP responder that uses the
   issuing CA's certificate
4. A test with ECDSA certificates and an OCSP responder that uses a
   delegate certificate

Each column that does not utilize an OCSP responder (i.e. "Soft Fail
Test" and "Malicious Server Test 2") represent two tests:

1. A test with RSA certificates
2. A test with ECDSA certificates

Each test MUST BE its own Evergreen task in order to
minimize the impact of OCSP caching. OCSP caching can exist at the
OS-level, user-level and/or application-level; having separate
Evergreen tasks should help minimize the impact of user-level and
application-level caching since Evergreen performs some cleanup
between test runs.

Since each test column represents four tests, and each test is run as
a separate Evergreen task, each Evergreen task SHOULD set a
``batchtime`` of 14 days to reduce how often these tests run (this
will not affect patch builds).

Any OCSP caches that persist between test runs (e.g. the OS-level OCSP
cache) MUST be cleared before configuring a certificate chain. This is
important because the Evergreen instance that is running a driver’s test
may have a cached response from a previous test run (Evergreen instances
are generally reused between test runs), and this cached result could
lead the driver or server to read stale data. See the
`Appendix <../ocsp-support.rst#os-level-ocsp-cache-manipulation>`__
for instructions on how to clear OS-level OCSP caches.

For each test, ensure that a ``mongod`` is running with the correct
certificate chain and that the mock OCSP responder is configured to
use the correct certificate and to report the expected revocation
status for that certificate (see `Mock OCSP Responder Testing Suite
`<#mock-ocsp-responder-testing-suite>`__ for configuration
details). Again, each test MUST BE its own Evergreen task in order to
minimize the impact of user-level and application-level OCSP caching

To assert whether a test passes or fails, drivers SHOULD create a
MongoClient with the options specified under “URI options”, connect to a
server and attempt to issue a ping command. The success or failure (due
to a TLS error) of the ping command should correlate with the expected
test result.

Drivers may wish to use a smaller value for ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS`` to
speed up tests (otherwise server selection will spin for the entire
duration even after a driver encounters a TLS error early).

Testing on Windows and macOS
-----------------------------

Additionally, because the Windows and macOS ``mongod`` do not support
stapling when a client connects, the following sets of tests will be
identical even if a driver supports stapled OCSP: {Test 1, Test 3} and
{Test 2, Test 4}. Therefore, when testing on Windows and macOS, a
driver MAY skip Test 1 and Test 2 if desired. A driver MAY also simply
choose to run all the tests in the table, irrespective of OS, in order
to simplify the testing procedure.

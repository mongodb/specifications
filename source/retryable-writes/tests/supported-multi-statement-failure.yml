# Each test expects an error due to successive network errors for the first
# write command in the batch. The fail point drops the connection after
# executing the write command but before its result would be returned, so we
# still observe changes to the collection. Additionally, our observations assert
# that the subsequent retry attempt abides exactly-once semantics.

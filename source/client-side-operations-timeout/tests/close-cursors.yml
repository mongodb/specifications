tests:
  # If a cursor is closed before it's fully iterated, the killCursors command should use the min of timeoutMS and
  # connectTimeoutMS as its timeout. If timeoutMS=0, the min should be connectTimeoutMS. Because some drivers ignore
  # errors from the killCursors command, tests in this file use command monitoring assertions to assert killCursors
  # failures.

  # connectTimeoutMS (20) < timeoutMS (30)

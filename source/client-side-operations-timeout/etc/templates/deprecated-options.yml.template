# Most tests in this file can be executed against any server version, but some tests execute operations that are only
# available on higher server versions (e.g. abortTransaction). To avoid too many special cases in templated tests, the
# min server version is set to 4.2 for all.

tests:
  # For each operation, run these tests:
  #
  # 1. socketTimeoutMS is ignored if timeoutMS is set. The test creates a client with socketTimeoutMS=1, configures and
  # a failpoint to block the operation for 5ms, runs the operation with timeoutMS=10000, and expects it to succeed.
  #
  # 2. wTimeoutMS is ignored if timeoutMS is set. The test creates a client with wTimeoutMS=1, runs the operation with
  # timeoutMS=10000, expects the operation to succeed, and uses command monitoring expectations to assert that the
  # command sent to the server does not contain a writeConcern field.
  #
  # 3. If the operation supports maxTimeMS, it ignores maxTimeMS if timeoutMS is set. The test executes the operation
  # with timeoutMS=1000 and maxTimeMS=5000. It expects the operation to succeed and uses command monitoring expectations
  # to assert that the actual maxTimeMS value sent was less than or equal to 100, thereby asserting that it was
  # actually derived from timeoutMS.

  # Tests for commitTransaction. These are not included in the operations loop because the tests need to execute
  # additional "startTransaction" and "insertOne" operations to establish a server-side transaction. There is also one
  # additional test to assert that maxCommitTimeMS is ignored if timeoutMS is set.

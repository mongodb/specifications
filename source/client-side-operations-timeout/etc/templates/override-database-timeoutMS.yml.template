tests:
  # For each database-level operation, we execute two tests:
  #
  # 1. timeoutMS can be overridden to a non-zero value for a MongoDatabase. Each test constructs uses the client entity
  # defined above to construct a database entity with timeoutMS=1000 and configures a fail point to block the operation
  # for 15ms so the operation succeeds.
  #
  # 2. timeoutMS can be overridden to 0 for a MongoDatabase. Each test constructs a database entity with timeoutMS=0
  # using the global client entity and configures a fail point to block the operation for 15ms. The operation should
  # succeed and the command sent to the server should not contain a maxTimeMS field.

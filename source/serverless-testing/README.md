# Atlas Serverless Tests

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: N/A

______________________________________________________________________

## Introduction

This file describes a subset of existing tests that drivers MUST use to assert compatibility with Atlas Serverless.

## Serverless Configuration

These tests MUST be run against a live Atlas Serverless instance. A new instance MUST be created each time the test
suite is run, and that instance MUST be used for all of the tests required by this specification. Once the tests are
finished, the instance MUST be deleted regardless of the outcome of the tests. The
[serverless directory in the drivers-evergreen-tools repository](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/drivers-evergreen-tools/tree/master/.evergreen/serverless)
contains scripts for creating and deleting Atlas Serverless instances, and the `config.yml` contains an example
Evergreen configuration that uses them to run the tests. It can take up to 15 minutes or so to provision a new Atlas
Serverless instance, so it is recommended to create one manually via the scripts in drivers-evergreen-tools that can be
reused for the initial implementation of the tests before moving to Evergreen patches.

Drivers MUST use the
[create-instance.sh](https://github.com/mongodb-labs/drivers-evergreen-tools/blob/master/.evergreen/serverless/create-instance.sh)
script in `drivers-evergreen-tools` to create a new Atlas Serverless instance for Evergreen tasks. The script writes a
URI for the newly created instance to a YAML expansions file:

- `SERVERLESS_URI` An SRV connection string to a load balancer fronting a single Atlas Serverless proxy.

The `expansions.update` Evergreen command can be used to read this file and copy the URI into a `SERVERLESS_URI`
environment variable.

## Test Runner Configuration

All tests MUST be run with wire protocol compression and authentication enabled.

In contrast to the [Load Balancer testing](../load-balancers/tests/README.md), which has separate URIs for load
balancers fronting a single or multiple servers, there is only a single URI for Atlas Serverless testing (i.e.
`SERVERLESS_URI`).

The TXT record for `SERVERLESS_URI` already specifies `loadBalanced=true` so drivers need not add that.

`SERVERLESS_URI` does not include authentication credentials. Drivers MUST specify a username and password (see:
[Required Variables](#required-variables)) when connecting to `SERVERLESS_URI`.

Drivers MUST use `SERVERLESS_URI` to configure both internal clients and clients under test (as described in the
[Unified Test Format spec](../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.md)).

### Required Variables

Managing the Atlas Serverless instances and connecting to them requires a few variables to be specified. The variables
marked "private" are confidential and MUST be specified as private Evergreen variables or used only in private Evergreen
projects. If using a public Evergreen project, xtrace MUST be disabled when using these variables to help prevent
accidental leaks.

- `${SERVERLESS_DRIVERS_GROUP}`: Contains the ID of the Atlas group dedicated to drivers testing of Atlas Serverless.
  The backing multi-tenant MongoDB (MTM) MUST have the `SINGLE_TARGET_SERVERLESS_DEPLOYMENT` feature flag enabled
  ([CLOUDP-117288](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CLOUDP-117288)).
- `${SERVERLESS_API_PUBLIC_KEY}`: The public key required to use the Atlas API for managing Atlas Serverless instances.
- `${SERVERLESS_API_PRIVATE_KEY}`: (private) The private key required to use the Atlas API for managing Atlas Serverless
  instances.
- `${SERVERLESS_ATLAS_USER}`: (private) The SCRAM username used to authenticate to any Atlas Serverless instance created
  in the drivers testing Atlas group.
- `${SERVERLESS_ATLAS_PASSWORD}`: (private) The SCRAM password used to authenticate to any Atlas Serverless instance
  created in the drivers testing Atlas group.

## Existing Spec Tests

Unified spec tests from all specifications MUST be run against Atlas Serverless. Since schema version 1.4, unified tests
can specify Atlas Serverless compatibility in their `runOnRequirements`.

Any prose and legacy spec tests defined in the following specifications MUST be included in a driver's Atlas Serverless
testing suite:

- CRUD
- Load Balancer
- Retryable Reads
- Retryable Writes
- Sessions
- Transactions (excluding convenient API)
  - Note: the killAllSessions command is not supported on Serverless, so the transactions tests may hang if an
    individual test leaves a transaction open when it finishes
    ([CLOUDP-84298](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CLOUDP-84298)).
- Versioned/Stable API
- Client Side Encryption
  - Drivers MUST test with a version of the `crypt_shared` shared library that matches the MongoDB Server version
    running in Serverless. See
    [Using crypt_shared](../client-side-encryption/client-side-encryption.md#enabling-crypt_shared).

Note that the legacy JSON/YAML test formats for these specifications were updated to include a new `runOnRequirement`
specifically for Atlas Serverless testing. To ensure these requirements are enforced properly, the runner MUST be
informed that it is running against an Atlas Serverless instance through some indicator (e.g. an environment variable).

Note that since Atlas Serverless testing uses a load balancer fronting a single Atlas Serverless proxy, the connection
string cannot be modified for `useMultipleMongoses`. Drivers SHOULD ignore `useMultipleMongoses` for purposes of Atlas
Serverless testing.

## Other Tests

Any other existing tests for cursor behavior that a driver may have implemented independently of any spec requirements
SHOULD also be included in the driver's Atlas Serverless testing suite. Note that change streams are not supported by
the proxy, so their spec and prose tests MUST be skipped.

Abstract
========

Presently, seeding a driver with an initial list of ReplicaSet or MongoS
addresses is somewhat cumbersome, requiring a comma-delimited list of host
names to attempt connections to.  A standardized answer to this problem exists
in the form of SRV records, which allow administrators to configure a single
domain to return a list of host names. Supporting this feature would assist
our users by decreasing maintenance load, primarily by removing the need to
maintain seed lists at an application level.

This specification builds on the `Connection String`_ specification. It adds a
new protocol scheme and modifies how the `Host Information`_ is interpreted.

.. _`Connection String`: ../connection-string/connection-string-spec.rst
.. _`Host Information`: ../connection-string/connection-string-spec.rst#host-information

META
====

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”,
“SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be
interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.

Specification
=============

The connection string parser in the driver is extended with a new protocol
``mongodb+srv`` as a logical pre-processing step before it considers the
connection string and SDAM specifications. In this protocol, the comma
separated list of host names is replaced with a single host name. The
format is::

    mongodb+srv://{hostname}/{options}

Seedlist Discovery
------------------

In this preprocessing step, the driver will query the DNS server for SRV
records on the ``{hostname}``, prefixed with ``_mongodb._tcp.``:
``_mongodb._tcp.{hostname}``. This DNS query is expected to
respond with one or more SRV records. From the DNS result, the driver now MUST
behave the same as if an ``mongodb://`` URI was provided with all the host names
and port numbers that were returned as part of the DNS SRV query result.

The priority and weight fields in returned SRV records MUST be ignored.

It is an error to specify a port in a connection string with the
``mongodb+srv`` protocol, and the driver MUST raise a parse error and MUST NOT
do DNS resolution or contact hosts.

It is an error to specify more than one host name in a connection string with
the ``mongodb+srv`` protocol, and the driver MUST raise a parse error and MUST
NOT do DNS resolution or contact hosts.

The driver MUST NOT attempt to connect to any hosts until the DNS query has
returned its results.

If the DNS result returns no SRV records, or no records at all, or a DNS error
happens, an error MUST be raised indicating that the URI could not be used to
find hostnames. The error SHALL include the reason why they could not be
found.

Clients SHOULD respect the default domain and current domain when looking up
the SRV record. For example, when using the non-FQDN ``servername`` and the
default domain set to ``example.com``, a Client should end up requesting the
SRV record for ``servername.example.com``.

Default Connection String Options
---------------------------------

As a second preprocessing step, a Client MUST also query the DNS server for
TXT records on the ``{hostname}``. If available, these
TXT records provide default connection string options. In most cases only one
TXT record is necessary. The maximum length of a TXT record string is 255
characters, but there can be multiple strings per TXT record. A Client MUST
support multiple TXT record strings and concatenate them as if they were one
single string in the order they are defined in each TXT record. The order of
multiple character strings in each TXT record is guaranteed. The maximum
total length of all strings in a single TXT record is about 65535 characters,
but DNS providers and software might arbitrarily limit this to a smaller
number. To allow for this case, a Client MUST allow for multiple TXT records
for the same host name and consider the options in all of them. Internally,
drivers should join multiple TXT records with a ``&`` and treat them as if
they were one connection string.

Information returned with each TXT record is a simple URI string, just like
the options in a connection string.

Although options in a connection string are separated by a ``&``, this
character MUST NOT be present to separate options between TXT records
as a separation is implied by using multiple TXT records.

TXT records MAY be queried either before, in parallel, or after SRV records.
Clients MUST query both the SRV and the TXT records before attempting any
connection to MongoDB.

A Client MUST use options specified in the Connection String, and options
passed in as parameters in code to the MongoClient constructor (or equivalent
API for each driver), to override options provided through TXT records.

If listable options, such as ``readPreferenceTags``, are present in a TXT
record AND in MongoClient constructor (URI, or options passed in code), then a
Client MUST discard *all* elements of this listable option obtained through
the TXT record(s) and *only* use these elements from the MongoClient
constructor.

.. _`Connection String spec`: ../connection-string/connection-string-spec.rst#defining-connection-options

If any connection string option in a TXT record is incorrectly formatted, a
Client must throw a parse exception.

Authentication credentials MUST NOT be supported as options through TXT
records.

This specification does not change the behaviour of handling unknown keys or
incorrect values as is set out in the `Connection String spec`_. Unknown keys
or incorrect values in default options specified through TXT records MUST be
handled in the same way as unknown keys or incorrect values directly specified
through a Connection String.

In case two TXT records for the same host name include the same connection
string option, a Client SHOULD warn the user. DNS does not guarantee the order
in which records are returned and hence this can cause conflicts. This
is especially important for options (such as readPreferenceTags) which may
occur multiple times and for which the order in which they appear is
important.

Example
=======

If we provide the following URI::

    mongodb+srv://server.mongodb.com/

The driver needs to request the DNS server for the SRV record
``_mongodb._tcp.server.mongodb.com``. This could return::

    Record                            TTL   Class    Priority Weight Port  Target
    _mongodb._tcp.server.mongodb.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27317 mongodb1.mongodb.com.
    _mongodb._tcp.server.mongodb.com. 86400 IN SRV   0        5      27017 mongodb2.mongodb.com.

The driver also needs to request the DNS server for the TXT records on
``server.mongodb.com``. This could return::

    Record              TTL   Class    Text
    server.mongodb.com. 86400 IN TXT   "ssl=true&connectTimeoutMS=250000"
    server.mongodb.com. 86400 IN TXT   "readPreference=secondaryPreferred&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1"

From the DNS results, the driver now MUST treat the host information as if the
following URI was used instead::

    mongodb://mongodb1.mongodb.com:27317,mongodb2.mongodb.com:27107/?ssl=true&connectTimeoutMS=250000&readPreference=secondaryPreferred&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1

If we provide the following URI with the same DNS (SRV and TXT) records::

    mongodb+srv://server.mongodb.com/?connectTimeoutMS=300000

Then the default in the TXT record for ``connectTimeoutMS`` is not used as
the value in the connection string overrides it. The Client MUST treat the host
information as if the following URI was used instead::

    mongodb://mongodb1.mongodb.com:27317,mongodb2.mongodb.com:27107/?ssl=true&connectTimeoutMS=300000&readPreference=secondaryPreferred&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1

Test Plan
=========

See README.rst in the accompanying `test directory`_.

.. _`test directory`: tests

Additionally, see the ``mongodb+srv`` test ``invalid-uris.yml`` in the `Connection
String Spec tests`_.

.. _`Connection String Spec tests`: ../connection-string/tests

Motivation
==========

Several of our users have asked for this through tickets:

* `<https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-201>`_
* `<https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-865>`_
* `<https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-536>`_

Design Rationale
================

The design specifically calls for a pre-processing stage of the processing of
connection URLs to minimize the impact on existing functionality.

Justifications
==============

Why Are Multiple Key-Value Pairs Allowed in One TXT Record?
-----------------------------------------------------------

One could imagine an alternative design in which each TXT record would allow
only one URI option. No ``&`` character would be allowed as a delimiter within
TXT records.

In this spec we allow multiple key-value pairs within one TXT record,
delimited by ``&``, because it will be common for all options to fit in a
single 255-character TXT record, and it is much more convenient to configure
one record in this case than to configure several.

Secondly, in some cases the order in which options occur is important. For
example, readPreferenceTags can appear both multiple times, and the order in
which they appear is significant. Because DNS servers may return TXT records
in any order, it is only possible to guarantee the order in which
readPreferenceTags keys appear by having them in the same TXT record.

Why Is There No Mention of UTF-8 Characters?
--------------------------------------------

Although DNS TXT records allow any octet to exist in its value, many DNS
providers do not allow non-ASCII characters to be configured. As it is
unlikely that any option names or values in the connection string have
non-ASCII characters, we left the behaviour of supporting UTF-8 characters as
unspecified.

Reference Implementation
========================

None yet.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

There are no backwards compatibility concerns.

Future Work
===========

In the future we could consider using the priority and weight fields of the
SRV records.

ChangeLog
=========

2017-11-17 — 1.1.6
    Remove language and tests for non-ASCII characters.

2017-11-07 — 1.1.5
    Clarified that all parts of listable options such as readPreferenceTags
    are ignored if they are also present in options to the MongoClient
    constructor.

    Clarified which host names to use for SRV and TXT DNS queries.

2017-11-01 — 1.1.4
    Clarified that individual TXT records can have multiple strings.

2017-10-31 — 1.1.3
    Added a clause that specifying two host names with a `mongodb+srv://`` URI
    is not allowed. Added a few more test cases.

2017-10-18 — 1.1.2
    Removed prohibition of raising DNS related errors when parsing the URI.

2017-10-04 — 1.1.1
    Removed from `Future Work`_ the line about multiple MongoS discovery. The
    current specification already allows for it, as multiple host names which
    are all MongoS servers is already allowed under SDAM. And this
    specification does not modify SDAM.

2017-10-04 — 1.1
    Added support for connection string options through TXT records.

2017-09-19
    Clarify that host names in `mongodb+srv://` URLs work like normal host
    specifications.

2017-09-01
    Updated test plan with YAML tests, and moved prose tests for URI parsing
    into invalid-uris.yml in the Connection String Spec tests.

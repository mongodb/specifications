Specification
=============

The performance monitoring specification defines a set of behaviour in the drivers for providing runtime information about commands to any 3rd party APM library as well internal driver use, such as logging.

-----------
Definitions
-----------

META
----

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.


Terms
-----

Document
  The term ``Document`` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of a BSON document.

GLE
  The term "GLE" refers to a ``getLastError`` command.


--------
Guidance
--------

Documentation
-------------

The documentation provided in code below is merely for driver authors and SHOULD NOT be taken as required documentation for the driver.


Operations
----------

All drivers MUST implement the API. Implementation details are noted in the comments when a specific implementation is required. Within each API, all methods are REQUIRED unless noted otherwise in the comments.


Operation Parameters
--------------------

All drivers MUST include the specified parameters in each operation, with the exception of the options parameter which is OPTIONAL.


Naming
------

All drivers MUST name operations, parameters and topic names as defined in the following sections. Exceptions to this rule are noted in the appropriate section. Class and interface names may vary according to the driver and language best practices.


Publishing & Subscribing
------------------------

The driver SHOULD publish events in a manner that is standard to the driver's language publish/subscribe patterns and is not strictly mandated in this specification.


Guarantees
----------

The driver MUST guarantee that every ``CommandStartedEvent`` has either a correlating ``CommandSucceededEvent`` or ``CommandFailedEvent``.

The driver MUST guarantee that the ``requestId`` of the ``CommandStartedEvent`` and the corresponding ``CommandSucceededEvent`` or ``CommandFailedEvent`` is the same. In the case of acknowledged writes on server version 2.4 [where the driver sends an operation followed by a ``getLastError``] the ``requestId`` MUST be either the ``requestId`` from the original message or the ``requestId`` from the ``getLastError``.

Unacknowledged/Acknowledged Writes
----------------------------------

For server versions that do not support write commands, the driver MUST treat an acknowledged write as a single command event, where the GLE command is ignored as a started event and the response to the GLE is treated as the reply in the ``CommandSucceededEvent``. Unacknowledged writes must provide a ``CommandSucceededEvent`` with a ``{ ok: 1 }`` reply.

A non-default write concern MUST be included in the published command. The default write concern is not required to be included.

Succeeded or Failed
-------------------

Commands that executed on the server and return a status of ``{ ok: 1.0 }`` are considered
successful commands and MUST fire a ``CommandSucceededEvent``. Commands that have write errors
are included since the actual command did succeed, only writes failed.

Error Handling
--------------

If an exception occurs while sending the operation to the server, the driver MUST generate a ``CommandFailedEvent`` with the exception or message and re-raise the exception.

Upconversion
------------

All legacy operations MUST be converted to their equivalent commands in the 3.2 server in the event's
``command`` and ``reply`` fields. This includes OP_INSERT, OP_DELETE, OP_UPDATE, OP_QUERY, OP_GET_MORE and
OP_KILL_CURSORS. Upconversion expectations are provided in the tests.

For cases where the upconverted commands would exceed the server's ``maxBsonObjectSize``, the driver MUST NOT
split the upconverted commands and leave the original upconversion intact.

Bulk Writes
-----------

This specification defines the monitoring of inidividual commands and in that respect MUST generate
an event for each command a bulk write executes. Each of these commands, however, must be linked
together via the same ``operationId``.

Implementation Notes
--------------------

Legacy wire protocol messages MUST be up-converted to the corresponding commands in order to ensure
that the data in the events follows the same format across all server versions. The provided tests
assert these conversions take place.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50 50

   * - Legacy Message
     - Upconverted Command

   * - ``OP_QUERY``
     - find command

   * - ``OP_QUERY`` with ``$explain``
     - explain command

   * - ``OP_QUERY`` to ``$cmd`` collection
     - command

   * - ``OP_GET_MORE``
     - getMore command

   * - ``OP_KILL_CURSORS``
     - killCursors command

   * - ``OP_INSERT``
     - insert command

   * - ``OP_UPDATE``
     - update command

   * - ``OP_DELETE``
     - delete command

Read Preference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In cases where queries or commands are embedded in a ``$query`` parameter when a read preference
is provided, they MUST be unwrapped and the value of the ``$query`` attribute becomes the
``filter`` or the command in the started event. The read preference will subsequently be dropped
as it is considered metadata and metadata is not currently provided in the command events.

---------
Rationale
---------

*1. Why does the specification treat all events as commands, even those that are not sent as such?*

As a public facing API, subscribers to the events should need no knowledge of the MongoDB wire
protocol or variations in messages depending on server versions. The core motivation behind the
specification was to eliminate changes in our drivers' implementations breaking third party APM
solutions. Providing a unified view of operations satisfies this requirement.

*2. Why are commands with* ``{ ok: 1 }`` *treated as successful and* ``{ ok: 0 }`` *as failed?*

The specification is consistent with what the server deems as a successful or failed command and
reports this as so. This also allows for server changes around this behaviour in the future to
require no change in the drivers to continue to be compliant.

The command listener API is responsible only for receiving and handling events sent from the lowest
level of the driver, and is only about informing listeners about what commands are sent and what
replies are received. As such, it would be innappropiate at this level for a driver to execute
custom logic around particular commands to determine what failure or success means for a particular
command. Implementators of the API are free to handle these events as they see fit, which may include
code that futher interprets replies to specific commands based on the presence or absence of other
fields in the reply beyond the ‘ok’ field.

--------
Security
--------

Some commands and replies will contain sensitive data and in order to not risk the leaking of this
data to external sources or logs their commands AND replies MUST be redacted from the events. The
value MUST be replaced with an empty BSON document. The list is as follows:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 50

   * - Command
   * - ``authenticate``
   * - ``saslStart``
   * - ``saslContinue``
   * - ``getnonce``
   * - ``createUser``
   * - ``updateUser``
   * - ``copydbgetnonce``
   * - ``copydbsaslstart``
   * - ``copydb``

Examples
--------

A Ruby subscriber to a query series and how it could handle it with respect to logging.

Ruby:

.. code:: ruby

  class LoggingSubscriber

    def started(event)
      Logger.info("COMMAND.#{event.command_name} #{event.connection} STARTED: #{event.command_args.inspect}")
    end

    def succeeded(event)
      Logger.info("COMMAND.#{event.command_name} #{event.connection} COMPLETED: #{event.command_reply.inspect} (#{event.duration}s)")
    end

    def failed(event)
      Logger.info("COMMAND.#{event.command_name} #{event.connection} FAILED: #{event.message.inspect} (#{event.duration}s)")
    end
  end

  subscriber = LoggingSubscriber.new
  Mongo::Monitoring::Global.subscribe(Mongo::Monitoring::COMMAND, subscriber)

  # When the subscriber handles the events the log could show:
  # COMMAND.query 127.0.0.1:27017 STARTED: { $query: { name: 'testing' }}
  # COMMAND.query 127.0.0.1:27017 COMPLETED: { number_returned: 50 } (0.050s)

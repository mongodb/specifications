--------

**Abstract**
------------

Version 4.0 of the server introduces multi-statement transactions.
This spec builds upon the `Driver Sessions Specification`_ to define how an
application uses transactions and how a driver interacts with the
server to implement transactions.

The API for transactions must be specified to ensure that all drivers and
the mongo shell are consistent with each other, and to provide a natural
interface for application developers and DBAs who use multi-statement
transactions.

**META**
--------

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in
`RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.

**Specification**
-----------------

**Terms**
~~~~~~~~~

This specification uses the terms defined in the
`Driver Sessions Specification`_ and `Retryable Writes Specification`_.
Additional terms are defined below.

Resource Management Block
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some programming languages have a concept of a code block that
automatically frees resources when control exits the block. Such a
pattern is known as context managers, "using" statements, RAII, etc..
This spec refers to such a pattern as a resource management block,
regardless of the programming language.

Read operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any CRUD method that uses a read preference. The listIndexes,
listCollections, and listDatabases, and RunCommand helpers are also
considered read operations.

Write operation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All operations that write and accept a ClientSession argument. All
MongoClient, Database, Collection helpers that write including (but not
limited to) creating, updating, or deleting databases, collections,
indexes, and users. Aggregate (even with $out) is considered a read
operation, see `Aggregate with $out is a read operation`_.

Retryable Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An error considered retryable by the `Retryable Writes Specification`_.

Command Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A server response with ok:0. A server response with ok:1 and
writeConcernError or writeErrors is not considered a command error.

Network Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any error or timeout that occurs while selecting a server or reading
from or writing to a network socket.

Error Label
^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting in MongoDB 4.0, any command error may include a top level
"errorLabels" field. The field contains an array of string error labels.
Drivers may also add error labels to errors that they return.

Transient Transaction Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any command error that includes the "TransientTransactionError" error
label in the "errorLabels" field. Any network error encountered running
any command other than commitTransaction in a transaction. If a network
error occurs while running the commitTransaction command then it is not
known whether the transaction committed or not, and thus the
"TransientTransactionError" label MUST NOT be added.

**Naming variations**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This specification defines names for new methods and types. To the
extent possible you SHOULD use these names in your driver. However,
where your driver's and/or language's naming conventions differ you
SHOULD continue to use them instead. For example, you might use
StartTransaction or start_transaction instead of startTransaction.

**Transaction API**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Transactions are built on top of Driver Session API. Applications can
run a transaction like this:

.. code:: python

    with client.start_session() as s:
        s.start_transaction()
        collection_one.insert_one(doc_one, session=s)
        collection_two.insert_one(doc_two, session=s)
        s.commit_transaction()

This section is an overview of the public API for transactions:

.. code:: typescript

    class TransactionOptions {
        /**
         * The readConcern to use for this transaction.
         */
        Optional<ReadConcern> readConcern;

        /**
         * The writeConcern to use for this transaction.
         */
        Optional<WriteConcern> writeConcern;

        /**
         * The readPreference to use for this transaction.
         */
        Optional<ReadPreference> readPreference;
    }

    class SessionOptions {
        /**
         * The default TransactionOptions to use for transactions started
         * on this session.
         */
        Optional<TransactionOptions> defaultTransactionOptions;

        // Options defined in other specifications...
    }

    interface ClientSession {
        /**
         * Starts a new transaction with the given options. This session's
         * defaultTransactionOptions is used when options is omitted.
         * Raises an error if this session is already in a transaction.
         *
         * The return type MAY be non-void if necessary to participate in
         * the programming language's resource management block idiom. The
         * type of the returned object, if any, MUST NOT be named
         * Transaction, see "Why is there no Transaction object?"
         */
        void startTransaction(Optional<TransactionOptions> options);

        /**
         * Commits the currently active transaction in this session.
         * Raises an error if this session has no transaction.
         */
        void commitTransaction();

        /**
         * Aborts the currently active transaction in this session.
         * Raises an error if this session has no transaction.
         */
        void abortTransaction();

        /**
         * Aborts any currently active transaction and ends this session.
         * MUST NOT raise an error.
         */
        void endSession();

        // Methods defined in other specifications...
    }

Each new member is documented below.

**TransactionOptions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is expected that the set of TransactionOptions will grow over time,
TransactionOptions MUST be designed such that future options can be
added without breaking backward compatibility.

readConcern
^^^^^^^^^^^

The readConcern to use for the first command, and only the first
command, in a transaction. Server transactions are started lazily with
the first command using this session. For supported values see
`Behavior of the readConcern field`_.

Note that the readConcern property is optional. The default value is
NULL. If readConcern is NULL the value will be inherited from this
session’s defaultTransactionOptions. If defaultTransactionOptions itself
is NULL or the readConcern in defaultTransactionOptions is NULL, the
readConcern is inherited from the MongoClient associated with this
session.

If the user supplies an explicit readConcern via a method option, the driver
MUST raise an error with the message "Cannot set read concern after starting a
transaction."
See `Users cannot pass readConcern or writeConcern to operations in transactions`_.

writeConcern
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The writeConcern to use for the commitTransaction and abortTransaction
commands. Note that the writeConcern property is optional. The default
value is NULL. If writeConcern is NULL the value will be inherited
from this session’s defaultTransactionOptions. If
defaultTransactionOptions itself is NULL or the writeConcern in
defaultTransactionOptions is NULL, the writeConcern is inherited from
the MongoClient associated with this session.

If the writeConcern is not the server default, then Drivers MUST add
the writeConcern to the commitTransaction and abortTransaction
commands. Drivers MUST NOT add the transaction’s writeConcern or any
writeConcern inherited from the collection, database, or client to any
preceding commands in the transaction.

If the user supplies an explicit writeConcern via a method option, the driver
MUST raise an error with the message "Cannot set write concern after starting a
transaction."
See `Users cannot pass readConcern or writeConcern to operations in transactions`_.

Drivers MUST raise an error if the user provides or if defaults would
result in an unacknowledged writeConcern. The Driver Sessions spec
disallows using unacknowledged writes in a session. The error message
MUST contain "transactions do not support unacknowledged write
concerns".

readPreference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The read preference to use for all read operations in this transaction.

Note that the readPreference property is optional. The default value is
NULL. If readPreference is NULL the value will be inherited from this
session’s defaultTransactionOptions. If defaultTransactionOptions itself
is NULL or the readPreference in defaultTransactionOptions is NULL, the
readPreference is inherited from the MongoClient associated with this
session.

The transaction’s read preference MUST override all other user
configurable read preferences, with the exception of drivers that allow
an operation level read preference. In this case, the driver MUST respect
the read preference specified by the user, allowing the server to report
an error.

In MongoDB 4.0, transactions may only read from the primary. If a read
is attempted and the transaction’s read preference is not Primary
drivers MUST raise an error containing the string "read preference in a
transaction must be primary". Drivers MUST NOT validate the read
preference during write operations or in startTransaction.
See `Why is readPreference part of TransactionOptions?`_.

.. code:: python

    client = MongoClient("mongodb://host/?readPreference=nearest")
    coll = client.db.test
    with client.start_session() as s:
        with s.start_transaction():
            coll.insert_one({}, session=s)
            coll.find_one(session=s)  # Error: "read preference in a transaction must be primary"

In the future, we might relax this restriction and allow any read
preference on a transaction.

**SessionOptions changes**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

defaultTransactionOptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default TransactionOptions to use for transactions started on this
session.

**ClientSession changes**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ClientSession is in one of five states: "no transaction", "starting
transaction", "transaction in progress", "transaction committed", and
"transaction aborted". It transitions among these states according to
the following diagram:

| |states|
| (`GraphViz source <client-session-transaction-states.dot>`__)

.. |states| image:: client-session-transaction-states.png
   :width: 6.5in
   :height: 3.68056in


When a ClientSession is created it starts in the "no transaction" state.
Starting, committing, and aborting a transaction transitions the session
between the "starting transaction", "transaction in progress",
"transaction committed", and "transaction aborted" states. If the
session is in the "transaction aborted" or "transaction committed"
state, then any operation using the session (besides commitTransaction
and abortTransaction) MUST reset the session state to "no transaction".

Note that "error" is not a state, it represents throwing an error due to
an invalid operation. When such errors are thrown the session state is
unchanged.

startTransaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method starts a new transaction on this session with the given
TransactionOptions. When options is omitted or if particular options are
not specified, drivers will use the defaultTransactionOptions from
ClientSession.options or inherit them from the session's client, as
described in the text above for each option. This session is in the
"starting transaction" state after this method returns.

If this session is in the "starting transaction " or "transaction in
progress" state, then Drivers MUST raise an error containing the message
"Transaction already in progress" without modifying any session state.

startTransaction SHOULD report an error if the driver can detect that
transactions are not supported by the deployment. A deployment does not
support transactions when the deployment does not support sessions, or
maxWireVersion < 7, or the topology type is Sharded, see `How to Check
Whether a Deployment Supports
Sessions <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/sessions/driver-sessions.rst#how-to-check-whether-a-deployment-supports-sessions>`__.
Note that checking the maxWireVersion does not guarantee that the
deployment supports transactions, for example a MongoDB 4.0 replica set
using MMAPv1 will report maxWireVersion 7 but does not support
transactions. In this case, Drivers rely on the deployment to report an
error when a transaction is started.

Drivers MUST increment the ``txnNumber`` for the corresponding server
session.

In programming languages that support resource management blocks,
startTransaction MAY be used to initiate such a block:

.. code:: python

    with client.start_session() as s:
        with s.start_transaction():
            collection_one.insert_one(doc1, session=s)
            s.commit_transaction()

The exact API SHOULD match the idioms of the programming language.
Depending on the conventions of the programming language, exiting the
block without calling commitTransaction MAY automatically abort the
transaction, or MAY abort the transaction when exiting due to an
exception and commit it when exiting normally. The driver MUST NOT
automatically commit the transaction when exiting the block due to an
exception. This means that for languages that use an RAII pattern for
resource management blocks, if object destruction can't tell if the
containing scope has exited normally or for an exception, object
destruction MUST NOT automatically commit the transaction.

If the driver returns a type to support resource management blocks, the
type MUST NOT be named "Transaction". The type MAY be named
"TransactionContext", "TransactionScopeGuard" or something similar for
your language. See `Why is there no Transaction object?`_

commitTransaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method commits the currently active transaction on this session.
Drivers MUST run a commitTransaction command with the writeConcern from
TransactionOptions. Drivers MUST report an error when the command fails
or the command succeeds but contains a writeConcernError. This session
is in the "transaction committed" state after this method returns — even
on error.

If this session is in the "no transaction" state, then Drivers MUST
raise an error containing the message "No transaction started".

If this session is in the "transaction aborted" state, then Drivers MUST
raise an error containing the message "Cannot call commitTransaction
after calling abortTransaction".

If this session is already in the "transaction committed" state, then
Drivers MUST re-run the previous commitTransaction.

It is valid to call commitTransaction when the session is in the
"starting transaction" or "transaction in progress" state. When the
session is in the "starting transaction" state, meaning no operations
have been performed on this transaction, drivers MUST NOT run the
commitTransaction command.

commitTransaction is a retryable write command. Drivers MUST retry once
after commitTransaction fails with a retryable error according to the
Retryable Writes Specification, regardless of whether retryWrites is set
on the MongoClient or not.

Drivers MUST add error labels to certain errors when commitTransaction
fails. See the `Error reporting changes`_ and `Error Labels`_ sections
for a precise description.

abortTransaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method aborts the currently active transaction on this session.
Drivers MUST run an abortTransaction command with the transaction’s
writeConcern. When this method completes the session moves to the
"transaction aborted" state.

It is only valid to call abortTransaction when the session is in the
"starting transaction" or "transaction in progress" state, otherwise
drivers MUST raise an error without modifying transaction state.

If this session is in the "no transaction" state, then drivers MUST
raise an error containing the message "No transaction started".

If this session is in the "transaction committed" state, then drivers
MUST raise an error containing the message "Cannot call abortTransaction
after calling commitTransaction".

If this session is already in the "transaction aborted" state, then
drivers MUST raise an error containing the message "Cannot call
abortTransaction twice".

It is valid to call abortTransaction when the session is in the
"starting transaction" or "transaction in progress" state. When the
session is in the "starting transaction" state, meaning, no operations
have been performed on this transaction, drivers MUST NOT run the
abortTransaction command.

abortTransaction is a retryable write command. Drivers MUST retry once
after abortTransaction fails with a retryable error according to the
`Retryable Writes Specification`_., regardless of whether retryWrites is set
on the MongoClient or not.

After the retryable write attempt, drivers MUST ignore all errors from
the abortTransaction command. Errors from abortTransaction are
meaningless to the application because they cannot do anything to
recover from the error. The transaction will ultimately be aborted by
the server anyway either upon reaching an age limit or when the
application starts a new transaction on this session, see `Drivers
ignore all abortTransaction
errors <#drivers-ignore-all-aborttransaction-errors>`__.

endSession changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This method ends a ClientSession. Drivers MUST call abortTransaction if
this session is in the "transaction in progress" state in order to
release resources on the server. Drivers MUST ignore any errors raised
by abortTransaction while ending a session.

Error reporting changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This spec introduces the concept of an "error label". Which labels are
applied to an error may be communicated from the server to the client,
or determined client-side. Any error reported by the driver in response
to a server error, server selection error, or network error MUST have an
API for determining whether it has a given label. In programming
languages that use class inheritance hierarchies for exceptions, the
presence of an error label MUST NOT affect an exception's class. Error
labels MUST be expressed as a collection of text strings, and it MUST be
possible for applications to check if an error has a label that is not
yet specified in MongoDB 4.0. Drivers MAY define constants for error
label strings that are known at this time.

Drivers MAY implement an error label API similar to the following:

.. code:: python

    try:
        session.commit_transaction()
    except (OperationFailure, ConnectionFailure) as exc:
        if exc.has_error_label("UnknownTransactionCommitResult"):
            print("tried to commit, don't know the outcome")

Drivers MAY expose the list of all error labels for an exception object.

Drivers MUST add the error label "TransientTransactionError" to network
errors thrown in a transaction except for network errors thrown during
commitTransaction.

Transactions Wire Protocol
--------------------------

The server requires each operation executed within a transaction to
provide an ``lsid`` and ``txnNumber`` in its command document. Each field is
obtained from the ClientSession object passed to the operation from the
application. Drivers will be responsible for maintaining a monotonically
increasing transaction number for each ServerSession used by a
ClientSession object. The ``txnNumber`` is incremented by the call to
startTransaction and remains the same for all commands in the
transaction.

Drivers that pool ServerSessions MUST preserve the transaction number
when reusing a server session from the pool with a new ClientSession
(this can be tracked as another property on the driver's object for the
server session).

Drivers MUST ensure that each transaction specifies a transaction number
larger than any previously used transaction number for its session ID.

**Constructing commands within a transaction**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Behavior of the startTransaction field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first command within a multi-statement transaction MUST include
``startTransaction:true``. Subsequent commands MUST NOT include the
``startTransaction`` field.

Behavior of the autocommit field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All operations within a multi-statement transaction (including
commitTransaction and abortTransaction) MUST include ``autocommit:false``,
to distinguish them from single-statement retryable writes.

Behavior of the readConcern field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any command that marks the beginning of a transaction MAY include a
``readConcern`` argument with an optional ``level`` and ``afterClusterTime``
fields. Read concern level 'local', 'majority', and 'snapshot' are all
supported, although they will all have the same behavior as "snapshot"
in MongoDB 4.0. To support causal consistency, if ``readConcern``
``afterClusterTime`` is specified, then the server will ensure that the
transaction’s read timestamp is after the ``afterClusterTime``.

All commands of a multi-statement transaction subsequent to the initial
command MUST NOT specify a ``readConcern``, since the ``readConcern`` argument
is only needed to establish the transaction’s read timestamp. If a
``readConcern`` argument is specified on a subsequent (non-initial) command,
the server will return an error.

Read concern level "snapshot" is new in MongoDB 4.0 and can only be used
when starting a transaction. The server will return an error if read
concern level "snapshot" is specified on a command that is not the start
of a transaction. Drivers MUST rely on the server to report an error if
read concern level snapshot is used incorrectly.

Behavior of the writeConcern field
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The commitTransaction and abortTransaction commands are the only
commands of a multi-statement transaction that allow a ``writeConcern``
argument. If a ``writeConcern`` argument is given on any other command of a
transaction, the server will return an error. The ``writeConcern`` argument
of the commitTransaction and abortTransaction commands has
semantics analogous to existing write commands.

Constructing the first command within a transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When constructing the first command within a transaction, drivers MUST
add the ``lsid``, ``txnNumber``, ``startTransaction``, and ``autocommit``
fields.

Drivers MUST include the transaction's readConcern in the first command in a
transaction if and only if the readConcern is supplied and not the server's
default. The readConcern MUST NOT be inherited from the collection, database, or
client associated with the driver method that invokes the first command.

Drivers MUST NOT add to subsequent commands the readConcern from the
transaction or any readConcern inherited from the collection, database, or
client.

This is an example of an insert command that begins a server transaction:

.. code:: typescript

    {
        insert : "test",
        documents : [{}],
        lsid : { id : <UUID> }
        txnNumber: NumberLong(1),
        // The "level" is optional, supported values are "local", "majority"
        // and "snapshot". "afterClusterTime" is only present in causally
        // consistent sessions.
        readConcern : {
            level : "snapshot",
            afterClusterTime : Timestamp(42,1)
        },
        startTransaction : true,
        autocommit : false
    }

This command uses the readConcern set on the transaction's TransactionOptions
during the ``startTransaction`` call. It is not inherited from a client,
database, or collection at the time of the first command.

The session transitions to the "transaction in progress" state after
completing the first command within a transaction — even on error.

Constructing any other command within a transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When constructing any other command within a transaction, drivers MUST
add the ``lsid``, ``txnNumber``, and ``autocommit`` fields. Drivers MUST NOT
automatically add the ``writeConcern``, ``readConcern``, or
``startTransaction`` fields. This is an example of a find command
within a transaction:

.. code:: typescript

    {
        find : "test",
        filter : {},
        lsid : { id : <UUID> }
        txnNumber : NumberLong(1),
        autocommit : false
    }

Generic RunCommand helper within a transaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your driver offers a generic RunCommand method on your database
object, the driver MUST add the ``lsid``, ``autocommit``, and ``txnNumber`` fields.
If the RunCommand operation is the first operation in a transaction then
the driver MUST also add the ``startTransaction`` and ``readConcern`` fields. A
driver MUST do this without modifying any data supplied by the
application (e.g. the command document passed to RunCommand).
If the user supplies an explicit readConcern as an argument to the runCommand
method in a transaction, the client MUST raise an error with the message
"Cannot set read concern after starting a transaction."

The RunCommand method is considered a read operation and MUST use the
transaction’s read preference.

The behavior is not defined if the command document passed to RunCommand
already contains some of the transaction fields.

**Interaction with Causal Consistency**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drivers MUST add ``readConcern.afterClusterTime`` to the command that starts
a transaction in a causally consistent session -- even if the command is
a write. Drivers MUST NOT add ``readConcern.afterClusterTime`` to subsequent
commands in a transaction.

**Interaction with Retryable Writes**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In MongoDB 4.0 the only supported retryable write commands within a
transaction are commitTransaction and abortTransaction. Therefore
drivers MUST NOT retry write commands within transactions even when
retryWrites has been enabled on the MongoClient. Drivers MUST retry the
commitTransaction and abortTransaction commands even when retryWrites
has been disabled on the MongoClient. commitTransaction and
abortTransaction are retryable write commands and MUST be retried
according to the `Retryable Writes Specification`_.

Retryable writes and transactions both use the ``txnNumber`` associated with
a ServerSession. For retryable writes, ``txnNumber`` would normally
increment before each retryable command, whereas in a transaction, the
``txnNumber`` is incremented at the start and then stays constant, even for
retryable operations within the transaction. When executing the
commitTransaction and abortTransaction commands within a transaction
drivers MUST use the same ``txnNumber`` used for all preceding commands in
the transaction.

**Server Commands**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

commitTransaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The commitTransaction server command has the following format:

.. code:: typescript

    {
        commitTransaction : 1,
        lsid : { id : <UUID> },
        txnNumber : <Int64>,
        autocommit : false,
        writeConcern : {...}
    }

abortTransaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The abortTransaction server command has the following format:

.. code:: typescript

    {
        abortTransaction : 1,
        lsid : { id : <UUID> },
        txnNumber : <Int64>,
        autocommit : false,
        writeConcern : {...}
    }

Both commands MUST be sent to the admin database.

The server response has the following format:

.. code:: typescript

    { ok : 1 }

In case of an error, the server response has the following format:

.. code:: typescript

    { ok : 0, errmsg : "...", code : <Number>, errorLabels: ["Label"] }

In case of a write concern error, the server response has the following
format:

.. code:: typescript

    { ok : 1, writeConcernError: {code: <Number>, errmsg : "..."} }

Error Reporting and Retrying Transactions
-----------------------------------------

Error Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting in MongoDB 4.0, any command error may include a top level
"errorLabels" field. The field contains an array of string error labels.

TransientTransactionError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any command error that includes the "TransientTransactionError" error
label in the "errorLabels" field. Any network error or server selection
error encountered running any command besides commitTransaction in a
transaction. In the case of command errors, the server adds the label;
in the case of network errors or server selection errors where the
client receives no server reply, the client adds the label.

Retrying transactions that fail with TransientTransactionError
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an exception with the "TransientTransactionError" label is thrown, an
application can retry the entire transaction from the beginning with a
reasonable expectation that it will succeed. For example:

.. code:: python

    def run_transaction(client):
        with client.start_session() as s:
            with s.start_transaction():
                collection_one.insert_one(doc1, session=s)
                collection_two.insert_one(doc2, session=s)

    while True:
        try:
            return run_transaction(client)
        except (OperationFailure, ConnectionFailure) as exc:
            if exc.has_error_label("TransientTransactionError"):
                print("Transient transaction error, retrying...")
                continue
            raise

In the above example, a transaction will never be committed twice. The
retry loop ends when the transaction commits successfully or the
transaction fails with a non-transient error.

An example of a non-transient transaction error is DuplicateKeyError,
which causes the server to abort the transaction. Retrying a transaction
that causes a DuplicateKeyError will again (likely) abort the
transaction, therefore such an error is not labeled "transient."

UnknownTransactionCommitResult
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The commitTransaction command is considered a retryable write. The
driver will automatically retry the commitTransaction once after a
retryable error. Although this adds a layer of protection, the driver’s
retry attempt of a commitTransaction may again fail with a retryable
error. In that case, both the driver and the application do not know the
state of the transaction.

The driver MUST add the "UnknownTransactionCommitResult" error label when
commitTransaction fails with a server selection error, network error, retryable
writes error, or write concern failed / timeout. (See
`A server selection error is labeled UnknownTransactionCommitResult`_
for justification.) The approximate meaning of the
UnknownTransactionCommitResult label is, "We don't know if your commit
has satisfied the provided write concern." The only write concern errors
that are not labeled with "UnknownTransactionCommitResult" are
CannotSatisfyWriteConcern (which will be renamed to the more precise
UnsatisfiableWriteConcern in 4.2, while preserving the current error
code) and UnknownReplWriteConcern. These errors codes mean that the
provided write concern is not valid and therefore a retry attempt would
fail with the same error.

Retrying commitTransaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an exception with this label is thrown, an application can safely
call commitTransaction again. If this attempt succeeds it means the
transaction has committed with the provided write concern. If this
attempt fails it may also have the "UnknownTransactionCommitResult" error
label. For example:

.. code:: python

    def run_transaction_and_retry_commit(client):
        with client.start_session() as s:
            with s.start_transaction():
                collection_one.insert_one(doc1, session=s)
                collection_two.insert_one(doc2, session=s)
                while True:
                    try:
                        s.commit_transaction()
                        break
                    except (OperationFailure, ConnectionFailure) as exc:
                        if exc.has_error_label("UnknownTransactionCommitResult"):
                            print("Unknown commit result, retrying...")
                            continue
                        raise

    while True:
        try:
            return run_transaction_and_retry_commit(client)
        except (OperationFailure, ConnectionFailure) as exc:
            if exc.has_error_label("TransientTransactionError"):
                print("Transient transaction error, retrying...")
                continue
            raise

**Test Plan**
-------------

See the `README <tests/README.rst>`_ for tests.

The Python driver serves as a reference implementation.

**Design Rationale**
--------------------

The design of this specification builds on the `Driver Sessions Specification`_
and modifies the driver API as little as possible.

Drivers will rely on the server to yield an error if an unsupported
command is executed within a transaction. This will free drivers from
having to maintain a list of supported operations and also allow for
forward compatibility when future server versions begin to support
transactions for additional commands.

Drivers ignore all abortTransaction errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the driver has cleared its client-side transaction state, then the
next operation it performs will be in a new transaction or no
transaction, which will cause any lingering transaction state on the
server (associated with this session) to abort. Therefore
abortTransaction can be considered fail-safe, and raising an exception
from it only complicates application code. Applications would have to
wrap abortTransaction in an exception-handling block, but have no useful
action to perform in response to the error.

abortTransaction does, however, raise an error if there is no
transaction in progress. We had considered making this situation raise
no error, as well. However, we want to raise an error from
abortTransaction if there is no transaction, because it discourages an
antipattern like this:

.. code:: python

    s.start_transaction()
    try:
        coll.insert_one({}, session=s)
        s.commit_transaction()
    except:
        # We don't know if it was the insert_one, the commit,
        # or some other operation that failed, so we must not
        # commit the transaction.
        s.abort_transaction()  # Raises a client-side error


If a user puts "commit" in the same exception handling block as the
other operations in the transaction, they don't know whether to retry
the commit or the whole transaction on error. We want such code to raise
an exception. One chance we have to do that is if a commit fails with a
network error and enters the exception handling block, where
abortTransaction throws "Cannot call abortTransaction after
commitTransaction".

Drivers add the "TransientTransactionError" label to network errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When any non-commitTransaction command fails with a network error within
a transaction Drivers add the "TransientTransactionError" label because
the client doesn't know if it has modified data in the transaction or
not. Therefore it must abort and retry the entire transaction to be
certain it has executed each command in the transaction exactly once.

Adding the "TransientTransactionError" label allows applications to use
the the same error label API for both network errors and command errors.
This also allows applications to distinguish between a network error
that occurs within a transaction from a network error that occurs while
committing a transaction.

Transactions in GridFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The GridFS spec has not been updated to support sessions, however some
drivers have already implemented support for it on their own. When the
GridFS spec has been updated to support sessions, then drivers that
implement that spec MUST also support transactions in GridFS because all
APIs that allow sessions MUST support transactions.

Drivers that have already implemented session support in GridFS MUST
also support transactions in GridFS. Drivers that have not implemented
ClientSession support in GridFS are not required to support
transactions (or sessions) in GridFS.

This spec does not require all drivers to implement transaction
support in GridFS because transactions in GridFS are not very useful:
transactions in 4.0 are too limited in time and space to operate on
large GridFS files. Additionally, GridFS as specified already has some
basic guarantees that make transactions less necessary: files are
immutable and they are created "atomically", from the primary's
perspective, because the file entry is only saved after all chunks are
uploaded.

Causal Consistency with RunCommand helper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Causal Consistency alone only applies to commands that read, and we
don't want to parse the document passed to runCommand to see if it's a
command that reads. In a transaction, however, any command at all that
starts a transaction must include ``afterClusterTime``, so we can add
``afterClusterTime`` to the document passed to runCommand without adding
per-command special logic to runCommand.

Calling commitTransaction with the generic runCommand helper is undefined behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applications should only use the ClientSession API to manage
transactions. Applications should not use a generic runCommand helper to
run the commitTransaction or abortTransaction commands directly. This
spec does not define the behavior of calling such commands, consistent
with other drivers specifications that do not define the behavior of
calling directly commands for which helper methods are available The
purpose of the generic runCommand method is to execute a command
directly with minimum additional client-side logic.

**Dependencies**
----------------

This specification depends on:

1. `Driver Sessions Specification`_
2. `Retryable Writes Specification`_

.. _Driver Sessions Specification: ../sessions/driver-sessions.rst

.. _Retryable Writes Specification: ../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.rst

**Backwards Compatibility**
---------------------------

The API changes to support transactions extend the existing API but do
not introduce any backward breaking changes. Existing programs that do
not make use of transactions will continue to compile and run correctly.

**Reference Implementation**
----------------------------

The `Python driver <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/>`_ serves
as a reference implementation.

**Future work**
---------------

-  Support retryable writes within a transaction.

-  Support transactions on secondaries. In this case, drivers would be
      required to pin a transaction to the server selected for the
      initial operation. All subsequent operations in the transaction
      would go to the pinned server.

-  Support for transactions that read from multiple nodes in a replica
      set. One interesting use case would be to run a single transaction
      that performs low-latency reads with readPreference "nearest"
      followed by some writes.

-  Support for unacknowledged transaction commits. This might be useful
      when data consistency is paramount but durability is optional.
      Imagine a system that increments two counters in two different
      collections. The system may want to use transactions to guarantee
      that both counters are always incremented together or not at all.

**Justifications**
------------------

Why is there no Transaction object?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use transactions an application already has to create and
manage a ClientSession object. Introducing a Transaction object would
result in another object that the application needs to manage. Moreover,
a server session can only have a single transaction in progress at a
time. We chose not to introduce a public Transaction object so that
applications only need to manage a single object and to more closely
mirror how transactions work on the server.

Some drivers' startTransaction methods will return an object as part of
the language's resource management block protocol. The object returned
by startTransaction MUST NOT be named Transaction, in order to reserve
that name for some future API extension. Additionally, by avoiding the
name Transaction, we prevent users from thinking they can run multiple
transactions in a session. Finally, we avoid the temptation to diverge
from this spec's API by adding a commit() or abort() method to the
object returned by startTransaction. Committing and aborting a
transaction is the responsibility of the ClientSession object in all
drivers.

Why is readPreference part of TransactionOptions?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Providing a read preference for the entire transaction makes it easier
for applications that use one or more non-primary read preferences for
non-transactional reads to run transactions under a single, primary
read-preference. Applications only need to set primary read preference
on the transaction instead of changing the read preference of all
operations.

Because primary is the only read preference allowed with transactions in
MongoDB 4.0, this specification could have omitted
TransactionOptions.readPreference, or at least defaulted the read
preference to primary instead of inheriting the client's read
preference. However, this would have required a breaking change circa
MongoDB 4.2 when we introduce secondary reads in transactions:
TransactionOptions will inherit the client's read preference in 4.2, so
for the sake of future-compatibility, TransactionOptions inherits the
client's read preference now.

We considered defaulting TransactionOptions.readPreference to primary in
4.0, overriding the client's read preference by default for convenience.
However, for consistency with other options-inheritance rules in our
specifications, transactions MUST inherit the client's read preference.

In MongoDB 4.0, the error "read preference in a transaction must be
primary" is thrown whenever the application attempts a read operation in
a transaction with a non-primary read preference. We considered throwing
this error from startTransaction instead, to make the error more
deterministic and reduce the performance burden of re-checking the
TransactionOptions on each operation. However, this behavior will have
to change when we introduce secondary reads in transactions. There will
then be new error scenarios, such as a transaction with secondary reads
followed by a write. It won't be possible in the future for
startTransaction to check that the read preference is correct for all
operations the application will perform in the transaction. Therefore,
we specify now that the readPreference must be checked per-operation.
(However, we have not completely planned how read preference validation
will behave in MongoDB 4.2.)

Users cannot pass readConcern or writeConcern to operations in transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For drivers that allow readConcern and/or writeConcern to be passed to a
particular operation, 
If the driver did not prohibit the readConcern parameter to methods in a
transaction, the following code would be ambiguous:

.. code:: python

   client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost/?readConcernLevel=majority")
   with client.start_session() as s:
       # Transaction uses readConcern majority.
       with s.start_transaction():
           # The first command in a transaction. Which readConcern?
           client.db.collection.distinct(
               readConcern={'level': 'snapshot'},
               session=s)

In this scenario, the driver must choose which of the two possible readConcerns
to use for the *first* command in the transaction. The server will accept either
without error, so the ambiguity MUST be resolved by raising a client-side error.

We *could* specify that if a user passes an explicit writeConcern to an
operation in a transaction, that the driver passes this writeConcern to the
server. The server correctly returns an error in this scenario; there is not the
same ambiguity with an explicit writeConcern as there is with an explicit
readConcern passed to the first operation in a transaction. For consistency, 
however, we specify that an explicit writeConcern passed to an operation in a
transaction provokes a client-side error, the same as for readConcern.

Another alternative is to silently ignore the readConcern and/or writeConcern
that the user has explicitly provided to a particular operation in a
transaction. This would be a surprising and undetectable deviation from the
user's explicit intent.

On the other hand, if a user configures the write concern of a client, database,
or collection, and then configures the same option on a transaction, the
transaction's configuration overrides the inherited configuration:

.. code:: python

    client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost/?w=majority")
    with client.start_session() as s:
        with s.start_transaction(writeConcern={'w': 1}):
            # Uses w: 1.
            client.db.collection.insert_one(
               {'_id': 1},
               session=s)

In this case the transaction options express a more immediate user
intent than the client options, so it is not surprising to override the
client options.

Aggregate with $out is a read operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We intend to migrate away from designs that require drivers to inspect
the contents of the aggregation pipeline and override user read
preferences for aggregate with $out. In general, our specifications
should stop defining different behaviors based on the contents of
commands.

A server selection error is labeled UnknownTransactionCommitResult
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drivers add the "UnknownTransactionCommitResult" to a server selection
error from commitTransaction, even if this is the first attempt to send
commitTransaction. It is true in this case that the driver knows the
result: the transaction is definitely not committed. However, the
"UnknownTransactionCommitResult" label properly communicates to the
application that calling commitTransaction again may succeed.

FAQ
---

What commands can be run in a transaction?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands are allowed inside transactions:

1.  find

2.  getMore

    -  Note that it is not possible to start a transaction with a
       getMore command, the cursor must have been created within the
       transaction in order for the getMore to succeed.

3.  killCursors

4.  insert

5.  update

6.  delete

7.  findAndModify

8.  aggregate (including $lookup)

    -  The $out stage is prohibited because it uses collection create
       and rename operations.

9.  distinct

10. geoSearch

Why don’t drivers retry after write concern timeout errors?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A write concern timeout error indicates that the command succeeded but
failed to meet the specified writeConcern within the given time limit.
Attempting to retry would implicitly double the application’s wtimeout
value so drivers do not retry.

What happens when a command object passed to RunCommand already contains a transaction field (eg. lsid, txnNumber, etc...)?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behavior of running such commands in a transaction are undefined.
Applications should not run such commands inside a transaction.

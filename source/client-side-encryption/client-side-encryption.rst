Abstract
========

MongoDB 4.2 introduced support for client side encryption, guaranteeing
that sensitive data can only be encrypted and decrypted with access to both
MongoDB and a separate key management provider (supporting AWS, Azure, GCP,
a local provider, and KMIP). Once enabled, data can be seamlessly encrypted
and decrypted with minimal application code changes.


META
====

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.

Terms
=====

encrypted MongoClient
   A MongoClient with client side encryption enabled.

data key
   A key used to encrypt and decrypt BSON values. Data keys are
   encrypted with a key management service (e.g. AWS KMS) and stored within a document in the
   MongoDB key vault collection (see `Key vault collection schema for data keys`_ for a description of the data key document). Therefore, a client needs access to both
   MongoDB and the external KMS service to utilize a data key.

MongoDB key vault collection
   A MongoDB collection designated to contain data keys. This can either be co-located with the data-bearing cluster, or in a separate external MongoDB cluster.

Key Management Service (KMS)
   An external service providing fixed-size encryption/decryption. Only data keys are encrypted and decrypted with KMS. Only AWS KMS (and a local service) is supported.

Customer Master Key (CMK)
   The underlying key AWS KMS uses to encrypt and decrypt. See `AWS Key Management Service Concepts <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys>`_.

schema
   A MongoDB JSON Schema (either supplied by
   the server or client-side) which may include metadata about encrypted
   fields. This is a JSON Schema based on draft 4 of the JSON Schema
   specification, `as documented in the MongoDB
   manual. <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/>`_.

libmongocrypt_
   A library, written in C, that coordinates communication,
   does encryption/decryption, caches key and schemas. `Located here <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`_.

mongocryptd_
   A local process the driver communicates with to determine
   how to encrypt values in a command.

csfle_
   This initialism, spelled in all-lowercase, refers to the *client-side
   field-level-encryption* dynamic library provided as part of a MongoDB
   Enterprise distribution. It replaces mongocryptd_ as the method of
   :ref:`marking-up a database command for encryption <subtype6.intent-to-encrypt>`.

   See also:

      - `Introduction on csfle <csfle_>`_
      - `Enabling csfle`_

ciphertext
   One of the data formats of `BSON binary subtype 6 <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/tree/master/source/client-side-encryption/subtype6.rst>`_, representing an encoded BSON document containing
   encrypted ciphertext and metadata.

FLE 1
   FLE 1 is the first version of Client-Side Field Level Encryption. FLE 1 is almost entirely client-side with the exception of server-side JSON schema.

FLE 2
   FLE 2 the second version of Client-Side Field Level Encryption. Data is encrypted client-side. FLE 2 supports indexed encrypted fields, which are further processed server-side.

encryptedFields
   A BSON document describing the FLE 2 encrypted fields. This is analogous to the JSON Schema in FLE 1. The following is an example encryptedFields in extended canonical JSON:

   .. code::

      {
          "escCollection": "escCollectionName",
          "eccCollection": "eccCollectionName",
          "ecocCollection": "ecocCollectionName",
          "fields": [
              {
                  "path": "firstName",
                  "keyId": { "$binary": { "subType": "04", "base64": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==" }},
                  "bsonType": "string",
                  "queries": {"queryType": "equality"}
              },
              {
                  "path": "ssn",
                  "keyId": { "$binary": { "subType": "04", "base64": "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB==" }},
                  "bsonType": "string"
              }
          ]
      }


Introduction
============

Client side encryption enables users to specify what fields in a
collection must be encrypted, and the driver automatically encrypts
commands and decrypts results. Automatic encryption is enterprise only.
But users can manually encrypt and decrypt with a new ClientEncryption
object.

Client side encryption requires MongoDB 4.2 compatible drivers, and is
only supported against 4.2 or higher servers. See `Why is a 4.2 server required?`_.

The following shows basic usage of the new API.

.. code:: python

   # The schema map identifies fields on collections that must undergo encryption.

   schema_map = open("./schemas.json", "r").read()

   # AWS KMS is used to decrypt data keys stored in the key vault collection.

   aws_creds = open("./aws_credentials.json", "r").read()

   # A client is configured for automatic encryption and decryption by passing
   # AutoEncryptionOpts. Automatic encryption is an enterprise only feature.

   opts = AutoEncryptionOpts(
       kms_providers={"aws": aws_creds},
       key_vault_namespace="db.datakeys",
       schema_map=schema_map)

   db = MongoClient(auto_encryption_opts=opts).db

   # Commands are encrypted, as determined by the JSON Schema from the schema_map.
   db.coll.insert_one({"ssn": "457-55-5462"})

   # Replies are decrypted.
   print(db.coll.find_one()) # { "ssn": "457-55-5462" } but stored and transported as ciphertext.

   # A ClientEncryption object is used for explicit encryption, decryption, and creating data keys.
   opts = ClientEncryptionOpts(kms_providers=kms, key_vault_namespace="db.datakeys")
   clientencryption = ClientEncryption(client, opts)

   # Use a ClientEncryption to create new data keys.
   # The master key identifies the CMK on AWS KMS to use for encrypting the data key.
   master_key = open("./aws_masterkey.json", "r").read()
   opts = DataKeyOpts (master_key=master_key)
   created_key_id = clientencryption.create_data_key("aws", opts)

   # Use a ClientEncryption to explicitly encrypt and decrypt.
   opts = EncryptOpts(key_id=created_key_id,
       algorithm="AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random")
   encrypted = clientencryption.encrypt("secret text", opts)
   decrypted = clientencryption.decrypt(encrypted)

There are many moving parts to client side encryption with lots of
similar sounding terms. Before proceeding to implement the
specification, the following background should provide some context.

The driver interacts with multiple components to implement client side
encryption.

.. image:: includes/components.png

The driver communicates withâ€¦

-  **MongoDB cluster** to get remote JSON Schemas.
-  **MongoDB key vault collection** to get encrypted data keys and create new data
   keys.
-  **A KMS Provider** to decrypt fetched data keys and encrypt new data keys.
-  **mongocryptd** to ask what values in BSON commands must be encrypted (unless
   csfle_ is in use).

The MongoDB key vault may be the same as the MongoDB cluster. Users may
choose to have data key stored on a separate MongoDB cluster, or
co-locate with their data.

MongoDB Key Vault collection
----------------------------
The key vault collection is a special MongoDB collection containing key
documents. See the appendix section `Key vault collection schema for data keys`_
for a description of the documents.

The key material in the key vault collection is encrypted with a separate
KMS service. Therefore, encryption and decryption requires access to a
MongoDB cluster and the KMS service.

KMS Provider
------------
A KMS provider (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS, the local provider, or KMIP)
is used to decrypt data keys after fetching from the MongoDB Key Vault, and
encrypt newly created data keys.


mongocryptd
-----------
`mongocryptd` is a singleton local process needed for auto-encryption when no
csfle_ library is used. It speaks the MongoDB wire protocol and the driver uses
mongocryptd_ by connecting with a MongoClient. By default, if csfle_ is
unavailable, the driver should attempt to automatically spawn mongocryptd_. If
the MongoClient is configured with `extraOptions.mongocryptdBypassSpawn` set to
|true|, OR `bypassAutoEncryption` is set to |true|, OR `bypassQueryAnalysis` is
set to |true| then the driver will not attempt to spawn mongocryptd_.

The mongocryptd_ process is responsible for self terminating after idling for a
time period. If |opt-csfle-required| is set to |true|, the driver will not
connect to mongocryptd_ and instead rely on csfle_ being available.


csfle
-----

csfle_ is a dynamically-loaded C++ library providing query analysis for
auto-encryption. It replaces mongocryptd_ for performing query analysis to
:ref:`mark-up sensitive fields within a command <subtype6.intent-to-encrypt>`.

Drivers are not required to load and interact with csfle_ directly. Instead,
they inform libmongocrypt_ where to find csfle_ and libmongocrypt_ will handle
csfle_ communication automatically.

See also: `Enabling csfle`_ for information on using enabling the csfle_
library.


libmongocrypt
-------------
libmongocrypt is a C library providing crypto and coordination with
external components. `Located here <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt>`_.

**libmongocrypt is responsible forâ€¦**

-  orchestrating an internal state machine.
-  asking the driver to perform I/O, then handling the responses.

   -  includes constructing KMS HTTP requests and parsing KMS responses.

-  doing encryption and decryption.
-  caching data keys.
-  caching results of listCollections.
-  creating key material.

**The driver is responsible forâ€¦**

-  performing all I/O needed at every state:

   -  speaking to mongocryptd_ to mark commands (unless csfle_ is used).

   -  fetching encrypted data keys from key vault collection (mongod).

   -  running listCollections on mongod.

   -  decrypting encrypted data keys with KMS over TLS.

-  doing I/O asynchronously as needed.

See `Why require including a C library?`_.

User facing API
===============

Drivers MUST NOT preclude future options from being added to any of the
new interfaces.

Drivers MAY represent the options types in a way that is idiomatic to
the driver or language. E.g. options MAY be a BSON document or
dictionary type. The driver MAY forego validating options and instead
defer validation to the underlying implementation.

Drivers MAY deviate the spelling of option names to conform to their
language's naming conventions and implement options in an idiomatic way
(e.g. keyword arguments, builder classes, etc.).

Drivers MAY use a native UUID type in place of a parameter or return type
specified as a BSON binary with subtype 0x04 as described in
`Handling of Native UUID Types <../uuid.rst>`.

MongoClient Changes
-------------------

.. code:: typescript

   class MongoClient {
      MongoClient(... autoEncryptionOpts: AutoEncryptionOpts);

      // Implementation details.
      private mongocrypt_t libmongocrypt_handle; // Handle to libmongocrypt.
      private Optional<MongoClient> mongocryptd_client; // Client to mongocryptd.
      private MongoClient keyvault_client; // Client used to run find on the key vault collection. This is either an external MongoClient, the parent MongoClient, or internal_client.
      private MongoClient metadata_client; // Client used to run listCollections. This is either the parent MongoClient or internal_client.
      private Optional<MongoClient> internal_client; // An internal MongoClient. Created if no external keyVaultClient was set, or if a metadataClient is needed
   }

   class AutoEncryptionOpts {
      keyVaultClient: Optional<MongoClient>;
      keyVaultNamespace: String;
      kmsProviders: Map<String, Map<String, Value>>;
      schemaMap: Optional<Map<String, Document>>; // Maps namespace to a local schema
      bypassAutoEncryption: Optional<Boolean>; // Default false.
      extraOptions: Optional<Map<String, Value>>;
      tlsOptions: Optional<Map<String, TLSOptions>>; // Maps KMS provider to TLS options.
      encryptedFieldsMap: Optional<Map<String, Document>>; // Maps namespace to encryptedFields.
      // bypassQueryAnalysis disables automatic analysis of outgoing commands.
      // Set bypassQueryAnalysis to true to use explicit encryption on indexed fields
      // without the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced licensed csfle shared library.
      bypassQueryAnalysis: Optional<Boolean>; // Default false.
   }

A MongoClient can be configured to automatically encrypt collection
commands and decrypt results.

Drivers MUST document that auto encryption is an enterprise-only
feature and that auto encryption only occurs on collection level
operations by including the following in the driver documentation for
AutoEncryptionOpts:

   Automatic encryption is an enterprise only feature that only applies to
   operations on a collection. Automatic encryption is not supported for
   operations on a database or view, and operations that are not bypassed
   will result in error (see `libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List`_).
   To bypass automatic encryption for all operations, set
   bypassAutoEncryption=true in AutoEncryptionOpts.

Explicit encryption/decryption and automatic decryption is a community
feature. A MongoClient configured with bypassAutoEncryption=true will
still automatically decrypt.

Drivers MUST document that auto encryption requires the authenticated
user to have the listCollections privilege action by including the
following in the driver documentation for MongoClient.

   Automatic encryption requires the authenticated user to have the
   `listCollections privilege
   action <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/listCollections/#dbcmd.listCollections>`__.

See `Why is client side encryption configured on a MongoClient?`_

keyVaultNamespace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The key vault collection namespace refers to a collection that contains all
data keys used for encryption and decryption (aka the key vault collection).
Data keys are stored as documents in a special MongoDB collection. Data
keys are protected with encryption by a KMS provider (AWS KMS, Azure key
vault, GCP KMS, a local master key, or KMIP).

keyVaultClient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The key vault collection is assumed to reside on the same MongoDB
cluster as indicated by the connecting URI. But the optional
keyVaultClient can be used to route data key queries to a separate
MongoDB cluster.

If a ``keyVaultClient`` is not passed, and the parent ``MongoClient`` is
configured with a limited ``maxPoolSize``, the ``keyVaultClient`` is set to an
internal ``MongoClient``. See `keyVaultClient, metadataClient, and the internal
MongoClient`_ for configuration behavior.

See `What's the deal with metadataClient, keyVaultClient, and the internal client?`_

keyVaultClient, metadataClient, and the internal MongoClient
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following pseudo-code describes the configuration behavior for the three ``MongoClient`` objects:

.. code::

   def getOrCreateInternalClient (client, clientOpts):
      if client.internalClient != None:
         return client.internalClient
      internalClientOpts = copy(clientOpts)
      internalClientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts = None
      internalClientOpts.minPoolSize = 0
      client.internalClient = MongoClient (internalClientOpts)
      return client.internalClient

   def configureAutoEncryptionClients (client, clientOpts):
      if clientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts.keyVaultClient != None:
         client.keyVaultClient = clientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts.keyVaultClient
      elif clientOpts.maxPoolSize == 0:
         client.keyVaultClient = client
      else:
         client.keyVaultClient = getOrCreateInternalClient (client, clientOpts)

      if clientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts.bypassAutomaticEncryption:
         client.metadataClient = None
      elif clientOpts.maxPoolSize == 0:
         client.metadataClient = client
      else:
         client.metadataClient = getOrCreateInternalClient (client, clientOpts)

Configuring the internal ``MongoClient`` MUST match the parent ``MongoClient``,
except ``minPoolSize`` is set to ``0`` and ``AutoEncryptionOpts`` is omitted.
This includes copying the options and host information from the URI, and other
non-URI configuration (monitoring callbacks, stable API, etc.).

Drivers MUST document that an additional ``MongoClient`` may be created, using
the following as a template:

   If a ``MongoClient`` with a limited connection pool size (i.e a non-zero
   ``maxPoolSize``) is configured with ``AutoEncryptionOpts``, a separate
   internal ``MongoClient`` is created if any of the following are true:

   - ``AutoEncryptionOpts.keyVaultClient`` is not passed.
   - ``AutoEncryptionOpts.bypassAutomaticEncryption`` is ``false``.

   If an internal ``MongoClient`` is created, it is configured with the same
   options as the parent ``MongoClient`` except ``minPoolSize`` is set to ``0``
   and ``AutoEncryptionOpts`` is omitted.

See `What's the deal with metadataClient, keyVaultClient, and the internal client?`_

kmsProviders
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Multiple KMS providers may be specified. The kmsProviders map values differ by
provider ("aws", "azure", "gcp", "local", and "kmip"). The "local" provider is
configured with master key material. The external providers are configured with
credentials to authenticate.

.. code:: typescript

   aws: {
      accessKeyId: String,
      secretAccessKey: String,
      sessionToken: Optional<String> // Required for temporary AWS credentials.
   }

   azure: {
      tenantId: String,
      clientId: String,
      clientSecret: String,
      identityPlatformEndpoint: Optional<String> // Defaults to login.microsoftonline.com
   }

   gcp: {
      email: String,
      privateKey: byte[] or String, // May be passed as a base64 encoded string.
      endpoint: Optional<String> // Defaults to oauth2.googleapis.com
   }

   local: {
      key: byte[96] or String // The master key used to encrypt/decrypt data keys. May be passed as a base64 encoded string.
   }

   kmip: {
      endpoint: String
   }

See `Why are extraOptions and kmsProviders maps?`_

Drivers MUST enable TLS for all KMS connections.

KMS provider TLS options
````````````````````````

Drivers MUST provide TLS options to configure TLS connections KMS providers.

The TLS options SHOULD be consistent with the existing TLS options for MongoDB
server TLS connections. The TLS options MUST enable setting a custom client
certificate, equivalent to the `tlsCertificateKeyFile` URI option.

Drivers SHOULD provide API that is consistent with configuring TLS options for
MongoDB server TLS connections. New API to support the options MUST be
independent of the KMS provider to permit future extension. The following is an
example:

.. code:: typescript

   class AutoEncryptionOpts {
      // setTLSOptions accepts a map of KMS provider names to TLSOptions.
      // The TLSOptions apply to any TLS socket required to communicate
      // with the KMS provider.
      setTLSOptions (opts Map<String, TLSOptions>)
   }

   class ClientEncryptionOpts {
      // setTLSOptions accepts a map of KMS provider names to TLSOptions.
      // The TLSOptions apply to any TLS socket required to communicate
      // with the KMS provider.
      setTLSOptions (opts Map<String, TLSOptions>)
   }

Drivers MUST raise an error if the TLS options are set to disable TLS.
The error MUST contain the message "TLS is required".

Drivers SHOULD raise an error if insecure TLS options are set.
The error MUST contain the message "Insecure TLS options prohibited".
This includes options equivalent to the following URI options:

- `tlsInsecure`
- `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`
- `tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`
- `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`
- `tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck`

See the OCSP specification for a description of the default values of
`tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/ocsp-support/ocsp-support.rst#tlsdisableocspendpointcheck>`_
and `tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/ocsp-support/ocsp-support.rst#tlsdisablecertificaterevocationcheck>`_
Drivers MUST NOT modify the default value of `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck` and
`tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck` for KMS TLS connections.

See `Why do KMS providers require TLS options?`_

schemaMap
^^^^^^^^^
Automatic encryption is configured with an "encrypt" field in a
collection's JSONSchema. By default, a collection's JSONSchema is
periodically polled with the listCollections command. But a JSONSchema
may be specified locally with the schemaMap option. Drivers MUST
document that a local schema is more secure and MUST include the
following in the driver documentation for MongoClient:

   Supplying a schemaMap provides more security than relying on JSON
   Schemas obtained from the server. It protects against a malicious server
   advertising a false JSON Schema, which could trick the client into
   sending unencrypted data that should be encrypted.

Drivers MUST document that a local schema only applies to client side
encryption, and specifying JSON Schema features unrelated to encryption
will result in error. Drivers MUST include the following in the driver
documentation for MongoClient:

   Schemas supplied in the schemaMap only apply to configuring automatic
   encryption for client side encryption. Other validation rules in the
   JSON schema will not be enforced by the driver and will result in an
   error.

bypassAutoEncryption
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drivers MUST disable auto encryption when the 'bypassAutoEncryption'
option is true and not try to spawn mongocryptd. Automatic encryption
may be disabled with the bypassAutoEncryption option.
See `Why is there a bypassAutoEncryption?`_.

extraOptions
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The extraOptions relate to the mongocryptd process, an implementation
detail described in the `Implementation`_ section:

.. code:: typescript

   {
      // Defaults to "mongodb://localhost:27020".
      mongocryptdURI: Optional<String>,

      // Defaults to false.
      mongocryptdBypassSpawn: Optional<Boolean>,

      // Used for spawning. Defaults to empty string and spawns mongocryptd from system path.
      mongocryptdSpawnPath: Optional<String>,

      // Passed when spawning mongocryptd. If omitted, this defaults to ["--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60"]
      mongocryptdSpawnArgs: Optional<Array[String]>

      // Override the path used to load the csfle library
      csflePath: Optional<string>;

      // If 'true', refuse to continue encryption without a csfle library
      csfleRequired: boolean;
   }

Drivers MUST implement extraOptions in a way that allows
deprecating/removing options in the future without an API break, such as
with a BSON document or map type instead of a struct type with fixed
fields. See `Why are extraOptions and kmsProviders maps?`_.

``extraOptions.csflePath``
``````````````````````````

:type: :ts:`undefined | string`
:default: :ts:`undefined`

.. |opt-path-override| replace:: `extraOptions.csflePath`_

Allow the user to specify an absolute path to a csfle_ dynamic library to
load. Refer:

- `Overriding the csfle Library Path`_
- `Path Resolution Behavior`_
- `Enabling csfle`_


``extraOptions.csfleRequired``
``````````````````````````````

:type: :ts:`boolean`
:default: |false|

.. |opt-csfle-required| replace:: `extraOptions.csfleRequired`_

If |true|, the driver MUST refuse to continue unless csfle_ was loaded
successfully.

If, after initializing a `libmongocrypt_handle`, csfle_ is detected to be
unavailable AND |opt-csfle-required| is |true|, the driver
MUST consider the `libmongocrypt_handle` to be invalid and return an error to
the user. Refer:

- `Enabling csfle`_
- `Managing mongocryptd`_
- `Detecting csfle Availability`_

encryptedFieldsMap
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``encryptedFieldsMap`` maps a collection namespace to an ``encryptedFields``.

``encryptedFieldsMap`` only applies to FLE 2.

If a collection is present on both the ``encryptedFieldsMap`` and ``schemaMap``, libmongocrypt_ will error on initialization. See :ref:`fle2-and-fle1-error`.

If a collection is present on the ``encryptedFieldsMap``, the behavior of ``CreateCollection()`` and ``Collection.Drop()`` is altered. See :ref:`fle2-createcollection-drop`.

Automatic encryption in FLE 2 is configured with the ``encryptedFields``.

If a collection is not present on the ``encryptedFields`` a server-side collection ``encryptedFields`` may be used by libmongocrypt_.
Drivers MUST include the following in the documentation for MongoClient:

   Supplying an ``encryptedFieldsMap`` provides more security than relying on an ``encryptedFields`` obtained from the server.
   It protects against a malicious server advertising a false ``encryptedFields``.

bypassQueryAnalysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Why is bypassQueryAnalysis needed?`_.

.. _fle2-createcollection-drop:

FLE 2 Create and Drop Collection Helpers
----------------------------------------

A collection supporting FLE 2 requires an index and three additional collections.

.. _create: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/create
.. _drop: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/drop

Create Collection Helper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drivers MUST support a BSON document option named ``encryptedFields`` for any
`create`_ command helpers (e.g. ``Database.createCollection()``). This option
will be interpreted by the helper method and MUST be passed to the `create`_
command.

A call to a driver helper ``CreateCollection(collectionName, collectionOptions)`` must check if the collection namespace (``<databaseName>.<collectionName>``) has an associated ``encryptedFields``. Check for an associated ``encryptedFields`` from the following:

- The ``encryptedFields`` option passed in ``collectionOptions``.
- The value of ``AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap[<databaseName>.<collectionName>]``.

If the collection namespace has an associated ``encryptedFields``, then do the following operations. If any of the following operations error, the remaining operations are not attempted:

- Create the collection with name ``encryptedFields["escCollection"]`` as a clustered collection using the options ``{clusteredIndex: {key: {_id: 1}, unique: true}}``.
  If ``encryptedFields["escCollection"]`` is not set, use the collection name ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.esc``.
  Creating this collection MUST NOT check if the collection namespace is in the ``AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap``.
- Create the collection with name ``encryptedFields["eccCollection"]`` as a clustered collection using the options ``{clusteredIndex: {key: {_id: 1}, unique: true}}``.
  If ``encryptedFields["eccCollection"]`` is not set, use the collection name ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecc``.
  Creating this collection MUST NOT check if the collection namespace is in the ``AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap``.
- Create the collection with name ``encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]`` as a clustered collection using the options ``{clusteredIndex: {key: {_id: 1}, unique: true}}``.
  If ``encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]`` is not set, use the collection name ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecoc``.
  Creating this collection MUST NOT check if the collection namespace is in the ``AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap``.
- Create the collection ``collectionName`` with ``collectionOptions`` and the option ``encryptedFields`` set to the ``encryptedFields``.
- Create the the index ``{"__safeContent__": 1}`` on collection ``collectionName``.

Drop Collection Helper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drivers MUST support a BSON document option named ``encryptedFields`` for any
`drop`_ command helpers (e.g. ``Database.dropCollection()``,
``Collection.drop()``). This option will only be interpreted by the helper
method and MUST NOT be passed to the `drop`_ command.

A call to a driver helper ``Collection.Drop(dropOptions)`` must check if the collection namespace (``<databaseName>.<collectionName>``) has an associated ``encryptedFields``. Check for an associated ``encryptedFields`` from the following:

- The ``encryptedFields`` option passed in ``dropOptions``.
- The value of ``AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap[<databaseName>.<collectionName>]``.
- If ``AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap`` is not null, run a ``listCollections`` command on the database ``databaseName`` with the filter ``{ "name": "<collectionName>" }``. Check the returned ``options`` for the ``encryptedFields`` option.

If the collection namespace has an associated ``encryptedFields``, then do the following operations. If any of the following operations error, the remaining operations are not attempted. A ``namespace not found`` error returned from the server (server error code 26) MUST be ignored:

- Drop the collection with name ``encryptedFields["escCollection"]``.
  If ``encryptedFields["escCollection"]`` is not set, use the collection name ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.esc``.
- Drop the collection with name ``encryptedFields["eccCollection"]``.
  If ``encryptedFields["eccCollection"]`` is not set, use the collection name ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecc``.
- Drop the collection with name ``encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]``.
  If ``encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]`` is not set, use the collection name ``enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecoc``.
- Drop the collection ``collectionName``.

ClientEncryption
----------------

.. code:: typescript

   class ClientEncryption {
      ClientEncryption(opts: ClientEncryptionOpts);

      // Creates a new key document and inserts into the key vault collection.
      // Returns the _id of the created document as a UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
      createKey(kmsProvider: String, opts: Optional<DataKeyOpts>): Binary;

      // An alias function equivalent to createKey.
      createDataKey(kmsProvider: String, opts: Optional<DataKeyOpts>): Binary;

      // Decrypts multiple data keys and (re-)encrypts them with a new masterKey, or with their current masterKey if a new one is not given.
      // Returns a RewrapManyDataKeyResult.
      rewrapManyDataKey(filter: Document, opts: Optional<RewrapManyDataKeyOpts>): RewrapManyDataKeyResult;

      // Removes the key document with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04) from the key vault collection.
      // Returns the result of the internal deleteOne() operation on the key vault collection.
      deleteKey(id: Binary): DeleteResult;

      // Finds a single key document with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
      // Returns the result of the internal find() operation on the key vault collection.
      getKey(id: Binary): Optional<Document>;

      // Finds all documents in the key vault collection.
      // Returns the result of the internal find() operation on the key vault collection.
      getKeys(): Iterable<Document>;

      // Adds a keyAltName to the keyAltNames array of the key document in the key vault collection with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
      // Returns the previous version of the key document.
      addKeyAltName(id: Binary, keyAltName: String): Optional<Document>;

      // Removes a keyAltName from the keyAltNames array of the key document in the key vault collection with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
      // Returns the previous version of the key document.
      removeKeyAltName(id: Binary, keyAltName: String): Optional<Document>;

      // Returns a key document in the key vault collection with the given keyAltName.
      getKeyByAltName(keyAltName: String): Optional<Document>;

      // Encrypts a BsonValue with a given key and algorithm.
      // Returns an encrypted value (BSON binary of subtype 6). The underlying implementation MAY return an error for prohibited BSON values.
      encrypt(value: BsonValue, opts: EncryptOpts): Binary;

      // Decrypts an encrypted value (BSON binary of subtype 6).
      // Returns the original BSON value.
      decrypt(value: Binary): BsonValue;

      // Implementation details.
      private mongocrypt_t libmongocrypt_handle;
      private MongoClient keyvault_client;
   }

   class ClientEncryptionOpts {
      keyVaultClient: MongoClient;
      keyVaultNamespace: String;
      kmsProviders: Map<String, Map<String, Value>>;
      tlsOptions: Optional<Map<String, TLSOptions>>; // Maps KMS provider to TLS options.
   }

The ClientEncryption encapsulates explicit operations on a key vault
collection that cannot be done directly on a MongoClient. Similar to
configuring auto encryption on a MongoClient, it is
constructed with a MongoClient (to a MongoDB cluster containing the key
vault collection), KMS provider configuration, keyVaultNamespace, and
tlsOptions. It provides an API for explicitly encrypting and decrypting values,
and managing data keys in the key vault collection.

See `Why do we have a separate top level type for ClientEncryption?`_ and `Why do we need to pass a client to create a ClientEncryption?`_.

When implementing behavior and error handling for key vault functions, Drivers
SHOULD assume the presence of a unique index in the key vault collection on the
``keyAltNames`` field with a partial index filter for only documents where
``keyAltNames`` exists when implementing behavior of key management functions.
Drivers MAY choose to not validate or enforce the existence of the unique index,
but MUST still be capable of handling errors that such a unique index may yield.

See `Why aren't we creating a unique index in the key vault collection?`_.

DataKeyOpts
-----------

.. code:: typescript

   class DataKeyOpts {
      masterKey: Optional<Document>
      keyAltNames: Optional<Array[String]> // An alternative to \_id to reference a key.
      keyMaterial: Optional<BinData>
   }

masterKey
^^^^^^^^^
The masterKey document identifies a KMS-specific key used to encrypt the new data
key. If the kmsProvider is "aws" it is required and has the following fields:

.. code:: typescript

   {
      region: String,
      key: String, // The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the AWS customer master key (CMK).
      endpoint: Optional<String> // An alternate host identifier to send KMS requests to. May include port number. Defaults to "kms.<region>.amazonaws.com"
   }

If the kmsProvider is "azure" the masterKey is required and has the following fields:

.. code:: typescript

   {
      keyVaultEndpoint: String, // Host with optional port. Example: "example.vault.azure.net".
      keyName: String,
      keyVersion: Optional<String> // A specific version of the named key, defaults to using the key's primary version.
   }

If the kmsProvider is "gcp" the masterKey is required and has the following fields:

.. code:: typescript

   {
      projectId: String,
      location: String,
      keyRing: String,
      keyName: String,
      keyVersion: Optional<String>, // A specific version of the named key, defaults to using the key's primary version.
      endpoint: Optional<String> // Host with optional port. Defaults to "cloudkms.googleapis.com".
   }

If the kmsProvider is "local" the masterKey is not applicable.

If the kmsProvider is "kmip" the masterKey is required and has the following fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
      keyId: Optional<String>, // keyId is the KMIP Unique Identifier to a 96 byte KMIP Secret Data managed object.
                               // If keyId is omitted, the driver creates a random 96 byte KMIP Secret Data managed object.
      endpoint: Optional<String> // Host with optional port.
   }

Drivers MUST document the expected fields in the masterKey document for the
"aws", "azure", "gcp", and "kmip" KMS providers. Additionally, they MUST
document that masterKey is **required** for these providers and is not optional.

The value of `endpoint` or `keyVaultEndpoint` is a host name with optional port
number separated by a colon. E.g. "kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" or
"kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443". It is assumed that the host name is not an IP
address or IP literal. Though drivers MUST NOT inspect the value of "endpoint"
that a user sets when creating a data key, a driver will inspect it when
connecting to KMS to determine a port number if present.

keyAltNames
^^^^^^^^^^^
An optional list of string alternate names used to reference a key. If a
key is created with alternate names, then encryption may refer to the
key by the unique alternate name instead of by \_id. The following
example shows creating and referring to a data key by alternate name:

.. code:: python

   opts = DataKeyOpts(keyAltNames=["name1"])
   clientencryption.create_data_key ("local", opts)
   # reference the key with the alternate name
   opts = EncryptOpts(keyAltName="name1", algorithm="AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random")
   clientencryption.encrypt("457-55-5462", opts)

keyMaterial
^^^^^^^^^^^

An optional BinData of 96 bytes to use as custom key material for the data key
being created. If ``keyMaterial`` is given, the custom key material is used for
encrypting and decrypting data. Otherwise, the key material for the new data key
is generated from a cryptographically secure random device.

RewrapManyDataKeyOpts
---------------------

.. code:: typescript

   class RewrapManyDataKeyOpts {
      provider: String
      masterKey: Optional<Document>
   }

The ``masterKey`` document MUST have the fields corresponding to the given
``provider`` as specified in `masterKey`_. ``masterKey`` MUST NOT be given if
it is not applicable for the given ``provider``.

RewrapManyDataKeyResult
-----------------------

.. code:: typescript

   class RewrapManyDataKeyResult {
      bulkWriteResult: BulkWriteResult;
   }

``bulkWriteResult`` is the `result of the bulk write operation
<../crud/crud.rst##write-results>`_ used to update the key vault collection with
rewrapped data keys.

See `Why does rewrapManyDataKey return RewrapManyDataKeyResult instead of BulkWriteResult?`_.

EncryptOpts
-----------

.. code:: typescript

   enum QueryType {
      Equality
   }

   class EncryptOpts {
      keyId : Optional<Binary>
      keyAltName: Optional<String>
      algorithm: String,
      contentionFactor: Optional<Int64>,
      queryType: Optional<QueryType>
   }

Explicit encryption requires a key and algorithm. Keys are either
identified by \_id or by alternate name. Exactly one is required.

keyId
^^^^^
Identifies a data key by \_id. The value is a UUID (binary subtype 4).

keyAltName
^^^^^^^^^^
Identifies a key vault collection document by 'keyAltName'.

algorithm
^^^^^^^^^
One of the strings:
- "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
- "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random"
- "Indexed"
- "Unindexed"

The result of explicit encryption with the "Indexed" algorithm must be processed by the server to insert or query. Drivers MUST document the following behavior:

   To insert or query with an "Indexed" encrypted payload, use a ``MongoClient`` configured with ``AutoEncryptionOpts``.
   ``AutoEncryptionOpts.bypassQueryAnalysis`` may be true. ``AutoEncryptionOpts.bypassAutoEncryption`` must be false.

contentionFactor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
contentionFactor only applies when algorithm is "Indexed".
It is an error to set contentionFactor when algorithm is not "Indexed".

queryType
^^^^^^^^^
queryType only applies when algorithm is "Indexed".
It is an error to set queryType when algorithm is not "Indexed".

User facing API: When Auto Encryption Fails
===========================================

Auto encryption requires parsing the MongoDB query language client side (with
the mongocryptd_ process or csfle_ library). For unsupported operations, an
exception will propagate to prevent the possibility of the client sending
unencrypted data that should be encrypted. Drivers MUST include the following in
the documentation for MongoClient:

   If automatic encryption fails on an operation, use a MongoClient
   configured with bypassAutoEncryption=true and use
   ClientEncryption.encrypt() to manually encrypt values.

For example, currently an aggregate with $lookup into a foreign collection is
unsupported (mongocryptd_ and csfle_ return errors):

.. code:: python

   opts = AutoEncryptionOpts (
      key_vault_namespace="keyvault.datakeys",
      kms_providers=kms)
   client = MongoClient(auto_encryption_opts=opts)
   accounts = client.db.accounts
   results = accounts.aggregate([
      {
         "$lookup": {
         "from": "people",
         "pipeline": [
            {
               "$match": {
                  "ssn": "457-55-5462"
               }
            }
         ],
         "as": "person"
      }
   ]) # Raises an error

   print (next(results)["person"]["ssn"])

In this case, the user should use explicit encryption on a client
configured to bypass auto encryption. (Note, automatic decryption still
occurs).

.. code:: python

   opts = AutoEncryptionOpts (
      key_vault_namespace="keyvault.datakeys",
      kms_providers=kms,
      bypass_auto_encryption=True)
   client = MongoClient(auto_encryption_opts=opts)

   opts = ClientEncryptionOpts (
      key_vault_client=client,
      key_vault_namespace="keyvault.datakeys",
      kms_providers=kms,
      bypass_auto_encryption=True)
   client_encryption = ClientEncryption(opts)

   accounts = client.db.accounts
   results = accounts.aggregate([
      {
         "$lookup": {
         "from": "people",
         "pipeline": [
            {
               "$match": {
                  "ssn": client_encryption.encrypt("457-55-5462", EncryptOpts(key_alt_name="ssn", algorithm="AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"))
               }
            }
         ],
         "as": "person"
      }
   ]) # Throws an exception

   print (next(results)["person"]["ssn"])

User facing API: View limitations
=================================

Users cannot use auto encryption with views. Attempting to do so results
in an exception. Drivers do not need to validate when the user is
attempting to enable auto encryption on a view, but may defer to the
underlying implementation.

Although auto encryption does not work on views, users may still use
explicit encrypt and decrypt functions on views on a MongoClient without
auto encryption enabled.

See `Why do operations on views fail?`_.

Implementation
==============

Drivers MUST integrate with libmongocrypt. libmongocrypt exposes a
simple state machine to perform operations. Follow `the guide to integrating libmongocrypt <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/integrating.md>`_.

Drivers SHOULD take a best-effort approach to store sensitive data
securely when interacting with KMS since responses may include decrypted
data key material (e.g. use secure malloc if available).

All errors from the MongoClient to mongocryptd_ or the csfle_ error category
MUST be distinguished in some way (e.g. exception type) to make it easier for
users to distinguish when a command fails due to auto encryption limitations.

All errors from the MongoClient interacting with the key vault
collection MUST be distinguished in some way (e.g. exception type) to
make it easier for users to distinguish when a command fails due to
behind-the-scenes operations required for encryption, decryption, or key
management.

Drivers MUST apply timeouts to operations executed as part of client-side encryption per `Client Side Operations
Timeout: Client Side Encryption
<../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.rst#client-side-encryption>`__.

Integrating with libmongocrypt
==============================

Each ClientEncryption instance MUST have one `libmongocrypt_handle`.

`The libmongocrypt C API documentation <lmc-c-api_>`_
  For information on how to initialize, encrypt, decrypt with libmongocrypt.

`The Guide to Integrating libmongocrypt <lmc-integrating_>`_
  For information about integrating the libmongocrypt library in a driver.

libmongocrypt exposes logging capabilities. If a driver provides a
logging mechanism, it MUST enable this logging and integrate. E.g. if
your driver exposes a logging callback that a user can set, it SHOULD be
possible to get log messages from libmongocrypt.

Drivers MUST propagate errors from libmongocrypt in whatever way is
idiomatic to the driver (exception, error object, etc.). These errors
MUST be distinguished in some way (e.g. exception type) to make it
easier for users to distinguish when a command fails due to client side
encryption.


.. index:: csfle
.. _Enabling csfle:

Enabling Command Marking with the csfle_ Library
=================================================

The MongoDB Enterprise distribution includes a dynamic library named
``mongo_csfle_v1`` (with the appropriate file extension or filename suffix for
the host platform). This library will be loaded by libmongocrypt_ when the
``mongocrypt_init`` function is invoked
`(from the libmongocrypt C API) <lmc-c-api_>`_ based on the search criteria that
are provided by the driver.

libmongocrypt_ allows the driver to specify an arbitrary list of directory
`search paths`_ in which to search for the csfle_ dynamic library. The
user-facing API does not expose this full search path functionality. This
extended search path customization is intended to facilitate driver testing with
csfle_ (Refer: `Search Paths for Testing`_ and `Path Resolution Behavior`).

.. note::

   The driver MUST NOT manipulate or do any validation on the csfle_ path
   options provided in extraOptions_. They should be passed through to
   libmongocrypt_ unchanged.


.. _search path:
.. _search paths:

Setting Search Paths
--------------------

For the user-facing API the driver MUST append the literal string
:ts:`"$SYSTEM"` to the search paths for the `libmongocrypt_handle` if
`bypassAutoEncryption` is not set to |true|, and MUST NOT append to the search
path if it is set to |true| or if the libmongocrypt_ instance is used
for explicit encryption only (i.e. on the ClientEncryption class).
For purposes of testing, a driver may use a different set of search paths.


.. rubric:: Explaination

The `search paths`_ array in libmongocrypt_ allows the driver to customize the
way that libmongocrypt_ searches and loads the csfle_ library. For testing
purposes, the driver may change the paths that it appends for csfle_ searching
to better isolate the test execution from the ambient state of the host system.

Refer to: `Path Resolution Behavior`_ and `Search Paths for Testing`_


.. _override path:

Overriding the csfle_ Library Path
----------------------------------

If |opt-path-override| was specified by the user, the driver MUST set the
csfle_ path override on the `libmongocrypt_handle`.

.. note::

   If a path override is set on a `libmongocrypt_handle` and libmongocrypt_
   fails to load csfle_ from that filepath, then that will result in a
   hard-error when initializing libmongocrypt_.


Path Resolution Behavior
------------------------

Drivers should include and note the following information regarding the behavior
of csfle_ path options in extraOptions_:

- If used, the `override path`_ must be given as a path to the csfle_ dynamic
  library file *itself*, and not simply the directory that contains it.

- If the given `override path`_ is a relative path and the first path component
  is the literal string :ts:`"$ORIGIN"`, the :ts:`"$ORIGIN"` component will be
  replaced by the absolute path to the directory containing the libmongocrypt_
  library that is performing the csfle_ search. This behavior mimics the
  ``$ORIGIN`` behavior of the ``RUNPATH``/``RPATH`` properties of ELF executable
  files. This permits bundling the csfle_ library along with libmongocrypt_ for
  creating portable application distributions without relying on a
  externally/globally available csfle_ library.

  .. note:: No other ``RPATH``/``RUNPATH``-style substitutions are available.

- If the `override path`_ is given as a relative path, that path will be
  resolved relative to the working directory of the operating system process.

- If an `override path`_ was specified and libmongocrypt_ fails to load csfle_
  from that filepath, libmongocrypt_ will fail to initialize with a hard-error.
  libmongocrypt_ will not attempt to search for csfle_ in any other locations.

- If libmongocrypt_ fails to load the csfle_ library after searching the system
  (and no `override path`_ is specified), libmongocrypt_ will proceed without
  error and presume that csfle_ is unavailable.


Search Paths for Testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. |---| unicode:: U+2014

Drivers can make use of different `search paths`_ settings for testing purposes.
These search paths use the following behavior:

- For csfle_ `search paths`_, if a search path string is :ts:`"$SYSTEM"`, then
  |---| instead of libmongocrypt_ searching for csfle_ in a directory named
  "``$SYSTEM``" |---| libmongocrypt_ will defer to the operating system's own
  dynamic-library resolution mechanism when processing that search-path. For
  this reason, :ts:`"$SYSTEM"` is the only search path appended when the driver
  is used via the user-facing API.
- The `search paths`_ also support the ``$ORIGIN`` substitution string.
- Like with the `override path`_, if a `search path`_ is given as a relative
  path, that path will be resolved relative to the working directory of the
  operating system process.
- If no `search paths`_ are appended to the `libmongocrypt_handle`, the
  resulting search paths will be an empty array, effectively `disabling csfle`_
  searching.

  In this case, unless an `override path`_ is specified, libmongocrypt_ is
  guaranteed not to load csfle_.


Detecting csfle_ Availability
------------------------------

csfle_ availability can only be reliably detected *after* initializing the
`libmongocrypt_handle`.

After initializing the `libmongocrypt_handle`, the driver can detect whether
csfle_ was successfully loaded by asking libmongocrypt_ for the csfle_
version string. If the result is an empty string, libmongocrypt_ did not load
csfle_ and the driver must rely on mongocryptd_ to mark command documents for
encryption.


.. _disabling csfle:

"Disabling" csfle_
------------------

For purposes of testing, a driver can "disable" csfle_ searching to ensure that
mongocryptd_ is used instead, even if a csfle_ library would be available.

As noted in `Path Resolution Behavior`_, csfle_ can be "disabled" on a
`libmongocrypt_handle` by omission:

1. Do not specify any `search paths`_,
2. AND do not specify a csfle_ library `override path`_ (|opt-path-override|).

This will have the effect that libmongocrypt_ will not attempt to search or load
csfle_ during initialization.

At the current time, no user-facing API is exposed that allows users to opt-out
of csfle_.


Loading csfle_ Multiple Times
------------------------------

Due to implementation restrictions, there must not be more than one csfle_
dynamic library loaded simultaneously in a single operating system process.
`libmongocrypt` will do its best to enforce this at the time that it loads
csfle_ while initializing a `libmongocrypt_handle`. `libmongocrypt` will keep
track of the open csfle_ library globally, and any subsequent attempt to use a
csfle_ library that does not exactly match the filepath of the already-loaded
csfle_ will result in an error.

If at least one `libmongocrypt_handle` exists in an operating system process
that has an open handle to a csfle_ library, subsequent attempts to initialize
an additional `libmongocrypt_handle` will fail if:

1. The new `libmongocrypt_handle` wants csfle_ (i.e. at least one `search path`_
   was specified or an `override path`_ was specified).
2. AND the initialization of that `libmongocrypt_handle` does not successfully
   find and load the same csfle_ library that was loaded by the existing
   `libmongocrypt_handle` that is already using csfle_.

Drivers MUST document this limitation for users along with the documentation on
the ``csfle*`` options in extraOptions_ by including the following:

   All `MongoClient` objects in the same process should use the same setting for
   |opt-path-override|, as it is an error to load more that one csfle_ dynamic
   library simultaneously in a single operating system process.

Once all open handles to a csfle_ library are closed, it is possible to load a
different csfle_ library than was previously loaded. The restriction only
applies to simultaneous open handles within a single process.


Managing mongocryptd
====================

If the following conditions are met:

- The user's ``MongoClient`` is configured for client-side encryption (i.e.
  `bypassAutoEncryption` is not |false|)
- **AND** the user has not disabled `mongocryptd` spawning (i.e. by setting
  `extraOptions.mongocryptdBypassSpawn` to |true|),
- **AND** the csfle_ library is unavailable (Refer:
  `Detecting csfle Availability`_),
- **AND** the |opt-csfle-required| option is |false|.

**then** ``mongocryptd`` MUST be spawned by the driver.

If the |opt-csfle-required| option is |true| then the driver MUST NOT attempt to
spawn or connect to `mongocryptd`.

.. note::

   Since spawning mongocryptd_ requires checking whether csfle_ is loaded, and
   checking whether csfle_ is available can only be done *after* having
   initialized the `libmongocrypt_handle`, drivers will need to defer spawning
   mongocryptd_ until *after* initializing libmongocrypt_ and checking for
   csfle_.

Spawning mongocryptd_
---------------------

If a MongoClient is configured for Client Side Encryption
(eg. bypassAutoEncryption=false), then by default
(unless mongocryptdBypassSpawn=true), mongocryptd MUST be
spawned by the driver. Spawning MUST include the command line argument
--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs. If the user does not supply one through
extraOptions.mongocryptdSpawnArgs (which may be either in the form
"--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60" or as two consecutive arguments
["--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs", 60], then the driver MUST append
--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60 to the arguments. This tells mongocryptd
to automatically terminate after 60 seconds of non-use. The stdout
and stderr of the spawned process MUST not be exposed in the driver (e.g.
redirect to /dev/null). Users can pass the argument --logpath to
extraOptions.mongocryptdSpawnArgs if they need to inspect mongocryptd
logs.

Upon construction, the MongoClient MUST create a MongoClient to
mongocryptd configured with serverSelectionTimeoutMS=10000.

If spawning is necessary, the driver MUST spawn mongocryptd whenever
server selection on the MongoClient to mongocryptd fails. If the
MongoClient fails to connect after spawning, the server selection error
is propagated to the user.


Connecting to mongocryptd_
--------------------------

Single-threaded drivers MUST connect with `serverSelectionTryOnce=false <../server-selection/server-selection.rst#serverselectiontryonce>`_
, connectTimeoutMS=10000, and MUST bypass `cooldownMS <../server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst#cooldownms>`__ when connecting to mongocryptd. See `Why are serverSelectionTryOnce and cooldownMS disabled for single-threaded drivers connecting to mongocryptd?`_.

If the ClientEncryption is configured with mongocryptdBypassSpawn=true,
then the driver is not responsible for spawning mongocryptd. If server
selection ever fails when connecting to mongocryptd, the server
selection error is propagated to the user.

.. note::

   A correctly-behaving driver will never attempt to connect to mongocryptd_
   when |opt-csfle-required| is set to |true|.

ClientEncryption
================
The new ClientEncryption type interacts uses libmongocrypt to perform
ClientEncryption operations. See the
`libmongocrypt API documentation <https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/src/mongocrypt.h.in>`_
for more information.

The ClientEncryption contains a MongoClient connected to the MongoDB
cluster containing the key vault collection. It does not contain a
MongoClient to mongocryptd.

See `Why does ClientEncryption have key management functions when Drivers can use existing CRUD operations instead?`_.

Key Vault collection
====================
The key vault collection is the specially designated collection
containing encrypted data keys. There is no default collection (user
must specify). The key vault collection is used for automatic and
explicit encryption/decryption as well as key management functions.

For key management functions that require creating, updating, or deleting key
documents in the key vault collection, the corresponding operations MUST be done
with write concern majority.

For encryption/decryption and key management functions that require reading
key documents from the key vault collection, the corresponding operations MUST
be done with read concern majority.

Some key management functions may require multiple commands to complete their
operation. Key management functions currently assume there is no concurrent
access of the key vault collection being operated on. Concurrent access to a
key vault collection being operated on may result in unexpected or undefined
behavior. Support for concurrent key management may be considered for future
work.

See `Support sessions in key management functions`_.

Auto encrypt and decrypt
========================
An encrypted MongoClient automatically encrypts values for filtering and
decrypts results.

The driver MUST use libmongocrypt to initiate auto encryption and decryption.
Create the BSON command meant to be sent over the wire, then pass that through
the libmongocrypt state machine and use the returned BSON command in its place.
The state machine is created with the libmongocrypt function
``mongocrypt_ctx_new`` and initialized with a ``mongocrypt_ctx_encrypt_init`` or
``mongocrypt_ctx_decrypt_init``. See the `libmongocrypt API documentation
<https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/src/mongocrypt.h.in>`_ for
more information.

An encrypted MongoClient configured with bypassAutoEncryption MUST NOT
attempt automatic encryption for any command.

Otherwise, an encrypted MongoClient MUST attempt to auto encrypt all
commands. Note, the underlying implementation may determine no
encryption is necessary, or bypass many checks if the command is deemed
to not possibly contain any encrypted data (e.g. ping). See the appendix
section: `libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List`_.

An encrypted MongoClient MUST attempt to auto decrypt the results of all
commands.

Drivers MUST raise an error when attempting to auto encrypt a command if
the maxWireVersion is less than 8. The error message MUST contain
"Auto-encryption requires a minimum MongoDB version of 4.2".

Note, all client side features (including all of ``ClientEncryption``)
are only supported against 4.2 or higher servers. However, errors are
only raised for automatic encryption/decryption against older servers.
See `Why is a 4.2 server required?`_.

Interaction with Command Monitoring
===================================
Unencrypted data MUST NOT appear in the data of any command monitoring
events. Encryption MUST occur before generating a CommandStartedEvent,
and decryption MUST occur after generating a CommandSucceededEvent.

Size limits for Write Commands
==============================
Automatic encryption requires the driver to serialize write commands as
a single BSON document before automatically encrypting with libmongocrypt
(analogous to constructing `OP_MSG payload type 0 <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/70628e30c96361346f7b6872571c0ec4d54846cb/source/message/OP_MSG.rst#sections>`_, not a document sequence).
Automatic encryption returns a single (possibly modified) BSON document as the
command to send.

Because automatic encryption increases the size of commands, the driver
MUST split bulk writes at a reduced size limit before undergoing automatic
encryption. The write payload MUST be split at 2MiB (2097152). Where batch
splitting occurs relative to automatic encryption is implementation-dependent.

Drivers MUST not reduce the size limits for a single write before automatic
encryption. I.e. if a single document has size larger than 2MiB (but less than
`maxBsonObjectSize`) proceed with automatic encryption.

Drivers MUST document the performance limitation of enabling client side
encryption by including the following documentation in MongoClient:

   Enabling Client Side Encryption reduces the maximum write batch size
   and may have a negative performance impact.

Data keys are needed for encryption and decryption. They are identified
in the intent-to-encrypt marking and ciphertext. Data keys may be
retrieved by querying the "_id" with a UUID or by querying the
"keyAltName" with a string.

Note, "status" is unused and is purely informational.

Example data key document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

   {
      "_id" : UUID("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"),
      "status" : 1,
      "masterKey" : {
         "provider" : "aws",
         "key" : "arn:aws...",
         "region" : "us-east-1"
      },
      "updateDate" : ISODate("2019-03-18T22:53:50.483Z"),
      "keyMaterial" : BinData(0,"AQICAH..."),
      "creationDate" : ISODate("2019-03-18T22:53:50.483Z"),
      "keyAltNames" : [
         "altname",
         "another_altname"
      ]
   }

BSON binary subtype 6
---------------------

BSON Binary Subtype 6 has a one byte leading identifier. The following
is a quick reference.

.. code:: typescript

   struct {
      uint8 subtype;
      [more data - see individual type definitions]
   }

Type 0: Intent-to-encrypt marking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: typescript

   struct {
      uint8 subtype = 0;
      [ bson ];
   }

Types 1 and 2: Ciphertext
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: typescript

   struct {
      uint8 subtype = (1 or 2);
      uint8 key_uuid[16];
      uint8 original_bson_type;
      uint32 ciphertext_length;
      uint8 ciphertext[ciphertext_length];
   }

See `Driver Spec: BSON Binary Subtype 6 <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/tree/master/source/client-side-encryption/subtype6.rst>`_ for more information.

JSONSchema "encrypt"
--------------------

The additional support for encryption in JSONSchema will be documented
in the MongoDB manual. But the following is an example:

.. code:: typescript

   encrypt : {
      bsonType: "int"
      algorithm: "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
      keyId: [UUID(...)]
   }

Each field is briefly described as follows:

========= ======================= ===============================================================================================
**Name**  **Type**                **Description**
bsonType  string                  The bsonType of the underlying encrypted field.
algorithm string                  "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random" or "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
keyId     string or array of UUID If string, it is a JSON pointer to a field with a scalar value identifying a key by keyAltName.

                                  If array, an array of eligible keys.
========= ======================= ===============================================================================================

libmongocrypt: Prohibitions and warnings
----------------------------------------

libmongocrypt MUST validate options. The following noteworthy cases are
prohibited:

-  Explicit encryption using the deterministic algorithm on any of the
   following types:

   -  array

   -  document

   -  code with scope

   -  single value types: undefined, MinKey, MaxKey, Null

   -  decimal128

   -  double

   -  bool

-  Explicit encryption on a BSON binary subtype 6.

The following cases MUST warn:

-  A local schema that does not include encrypted fields.

libmongocrypt: Collection info caching
--------------------------------------

libmongocrypt will cache the collection infos so encryption with remote
schemas need not run listCollections every time. Collection infos (or
lack thereof) are cached for one minute. This is not configurable. After
expiration, subsequent attempts to encrypt will result in libmongocrypt
requesting a new collection info.

A collection info result indicates if the collection is really a view.
If it is, libmongocrypt returns an error since it does not know the
schema of the underlying collection.

A collection info with validators that aside from one top level
$jsonSchema are considered an error.

libmongocrypt: Data key caching
-------------------------------

Data keys are cached in libmongocrypt for one minute. This is not
configurable, and there is no maximum number of keys in the cache. The
data key material is stored securely. It will not be paged to disk and
the memory will be properly zero'ed out after freeing.

libmongocrypt: Crypto implementation
------------------------------------

libmongocrypt uses AEAD_SHA256_CBC_HMAC512 for both "randomized" and
"deterministic" encryption algorithms. It is described in this `IETF document draft <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2-05>`__.
For "randomized", libmongocrypt securely creates a random IV. For
"deterministic", libmongocrypt securely creates a random IV key and any
given encryption operation will derive the IV from the IV key and the
field plaintext data.

libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List
-----------------------------------------

libmongocrypt determines whether or not the command requires encryption
(i.e. is sent to mongocryptd) based on the table below. Commands not
listed in this table will result in an error returned by libmongocrypt.

======================== ===========
**Command**              **Action**

======================== ===========

All AUTOENCRYPT commands are sent to mongocryptd, even if there is no
JSONSchema. This is to ensure that commands that reference other
collections (e.g. aggregate with $lookup) are handled properly.

Rationale
=========

Design Principles
-----------------
In addition to the `Driver
Mantras <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications#driver-mantras>`__
there are design principles specific to this project.

1. Make encryption easy to enable
---------------------------------
Users should be able to enable encryption with minimal application
change.

2. Minimize risk of exposing sensitive data
-------------------------------------------
Storing or querying with unencrypted data can have dire consequences,
because users may not be made aware immediately. When in doubt, we
should error. It should be clear to the user when an operation gets
encrypted and when one doesn't.

3. Minimize API
---------------
The first version of Client Side Encryption is to get signal. If it
becomes popular, further improvements will be made (removing mongocryptd
process, support for more queries, better performance). But the public
API we provide now will stick around for the long-term. So let's keep it
minimal to accomplish our goals.

How did we arrive at this API?
------------------------------
The API for client side encryption underwent multiple iterations during
the design process.

Why is client side encryption configured on a MongoClient?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is state that must be shared among all auto encrypted collections:
the MongoClient to mongocryptd and the handle to libmongocrypt (because
key caching + JSONSchema caching occurs in libmongocrypt).

Why not make auto encryption "opt-in"?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because auto encryption is specified with a collection JSONSchema, we
cannot auto encrypt database or client operations. So we cannot know if
the user is passing sensitive data as a filter to a database/client
change stream or a currentOp command for example. We also must always
fail on view operations. We considered making auto encryption opt-in for
collections. But we decided against this. It is much simpler for users
to enable auto encryption without enumerating all collections with
encryption in the common case of using remote JSONSchemas.

Note, this takes the trade-off of a better user experience over less
safety. If a user mistakenly assumes that auto encryption occurs on a
database, or on a collection doing a $(graph)lookup on a collection with
auto encryption, they may end up sending unencrypted data.

Why are auto encrypted collections configured at level of MongoClient?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In a previous iteration of the design, we proposed enabling auto
encryption only in db.getCollection() for better usability. But this
better aligns with our design principles.

-  Safer. Users won't forget to enable auto encryption on one call to
   db.getCollection()
-  Easier. It only requires changing MongoClient code instead of every
   db.getCollection()

Why do we have a separate top level type for ClientEncryption?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The encrypt/decrypt and createDataKey functions were originally placed
on MongoClient. But, then we'd have API that depends on optional
configuration. A new top level type seemed warranted.

Why not pass the ClientEncryption into db.getCollection() to enable auto encryption?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As it is now, a ClientEncryption and a MongoClient cannot share state
(libmongocrypt handle or MongoClient to mongocryptd). Foreseeably, they
could share state if auto encryption was enabled by passing a ClientEncryption
object like:

db.getCollection ("coll", { autoEncrypt: { clientEncryption:
clientEncryption } })

But this would require a MongoCollection to peek into the internals of a
ClientEncryption object. This is messy and language dependent to
implement and makes mocking out the ClientEncryption difficult for tests.

Why do we need to pass a client to create a ClientEncryption?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We need to support an external key vault collection (i.e. on another MongoDB
cluster).

Why are extraOptions and kmsProviders maps?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because we don't want AWS as part of the public types and we don't want
to put mongocryptd_ and csfle_ options as types since mongocryptd is an
implementation detail we'd like to hide as much as possible.

Why is there a bypassAutoEncryption?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

bypassAutoEncryption still supports auto decryption. In cases where
mongocryptd_ or csfle_ cannot analyze a query, it's still useful to provide auto
decryption. Just like static program analysis cannot always prove that a
runtime invariant holds, mongocryptd_/csfle_ cannot always prove that a query
will be safe with respect to encryption at runtime.

Why not require compatibility between mongocryptd and the server?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

It isn't necessary or unsafe if mongocryptd parses an old version of
MQL. Consider what happens when we add a new operator, $newOperator. If
it properly encrypts a value in the $newOperator expression and sends it
to an old server that doesn't have $newOperator, that's a mistake but
not a security hole. Also if the app passes a query with $newOperator to
mongocryptd, and mongocryptd doesn't know about $newOperator, then it
will error, "Unrecognized operator $newOperator" or something. Also a
mistake, not a security hole.

So long as mongocryptd errors on unrecognized expressions, we don't need
version compatibility between the mongocryptd and server for the sake of
security.

Why cache keys?
---------------

We can't re-fetch the key on each operation, the performance goal for
this project requires us to cache. We do need a revocation mechanism,
based upon periodic checking from the client. Initially this window will
not be configurable.

Why require including a C library?
----------------------------------

-  libmongocrypt deduplicates a lot of the work: JSONSchema cache, KMS
   message construction/parsing, key caching, and encryption/decryption.
-  Our "best-effort" of storing decrypted key material securely is best
   accomplished with a C library.
-  Having crypto done in one centralized C library makes it much easier
   to audit the crypto code.

Why warn if a local schema does not have encrypted fields?
----------------------------------------------------------

Because that is the only use of local schemas. No other JSONSchema
validators have any function. It's likely the user misconfigured
encryption.

Why limit to one top-level $jsonSchema?
---------------------------------------

-  If we allow siblings, we can run into cases where the user specifies
   a top-level $and/$or or any arbitrary match-expression that could
   have nested $jsonSchema's.
-  Furthermore, the initial versions of mongocryptd_ and csfle_ are only
   implementing query analysis when the validator consists of a single
   $jsonSchema predicate. This helps to simplify the mongocryptd_ and csfle_
   logic, and unifies it with the case where users configure their schemas
   directly in the driver.

Why not allow schemas to be configured at runtime?
--------------------------------------------------

We could have something like Collection::setEncryptionSchema(), but
users can simply recreate the client to set new local schemas.

Why not support other AWS auth mechanisms?
------------------------------------------

We could potentially authenticate against AWS in a more sophisticated
way, like read credentials from ~/.aws/credentials or assuming a role
with EC2 instance metadata. But we've decided to implement the simplest
authentication mechanism for v1, and defer more sophisticated ones as
future work.

Why not pass a URI for external key vault collections instead of a MongoClient?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some configuration on a MongoClient can only be done programmatically.
E.g. in Java TLS configuration can only be done at runtime since it is
abstracted in an SSLContext which cannot be accessed or altered by the
driver.

What happened to multiple key vault collections?
------------------------------------------------

An earlier revision of this specification supported multiple active key
vaults with the notion of a "key vault collection alias". The key vault
collection alias identified one of possibly many key vault collections
that stored the key to decrypt the ciphertext. However, enforcing one
key vault collection is a reasonable restriction for users. There isn't
clear value in having multiple key vault collections. And having active
multiple key vault collections is not necessary to migrate key vault
collections.

Why auto encrypt a command instead of a wire protocol message?
--------------------------------------------------------------

-  It is significantly easier to implement communication in drivers if
   libmongocrypt gives back BSON object that can be passed to run
   command.
-  mongocryptd cannot return document sequences, so it will return an
   array of documents anyway.
-  Though it is foreseeable that a driver can take the final result of
   encryption and turn it into an OP_MSG document sequence, it does not
   seem worthwhile to impose extra complexity in this case.

Why is a failure to decrypt always an error?
--------------------------------------------

In the original design we proposed *not* to error if decryption failed
due to a missing key. But, it's not clear this is a needed
functionality, it goes against our principle of "Minimize API", and
there's a simple recourse for users: bypass mongocryptd and explicitly
decrypt instead.

Why are there no APM events for mongocryptd?
--------------------------------------------

Though it may be helpful for debugging to expose APM events for
mongocryptd, mongocryptd is an implementation detail we'd like to have
the freedom to remove in the future. So we want to expose mongocryptd as
little as possible.

Why aren't we creating a unique index in the key vault collection?
------------------------------------------------------------------

There should be a unique index on the ``keyAltNames`` field with a partial index
filter for only documents where ``keyAltNames`` exists. Although GridFS
automatically creates indexes as a convenience upon first write, it has
been problematic before due to requiring the ``createIndex`` privilege, which a
user might not have if they are just querying the key vault collection
with find and adding keys with insert.

See also https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/privilege-actions/#mongodb-authaction-createIndex.

Why do operations on views fail?
--------------------------------

Currently, the driver does not resolve the entire view pipeline, which
would be necessary to know the schema of the underlying collection. But,
the driver does know whether or not a namespace is a view based on the
response to listCollections. And the driver will run listCollections on
all namespaces omitted from the schemaMap.

Why is a 4.2 server required?
-----------------------------

Limiting to 4.2 reduces testing complexity. Additionally The ``encrypt``
subdocument in JSON schema is only supported on 4.2 or higher servers.
Although not technically necessary for client side encryption, it does
provide a fallback against accidentally sending unencrypted data from
misconfigured clients.

Why are serverSelectionTryOnce and cooldownMS disabled for single-threaded drivers connecting to mongocryptd?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, single threaded clients set serverSelectionTryOnce to true, which
means server selection fails if a topology scan fails the first time (i.e. it
will not make repeat attempts until serverSelectionTimeoutMS expires). This
behavior is overriden since there may be a small delay between spawning
mongocryptd (which the driver may be responsible for) and for mongocryptd to
listen on sockets. See the Server Selection spec description of `serverSelectionTryOnce <../server-selection/server-selection.rst#serverselectiontryonce>`_.

Similarly, single threaded clients will by default wait for 5 second cooldown
period after failing to connect to a server before making another attempt.
Meaning if the first attempt to mongocryptd fails to connect, then the user
would observe a 5 second delay. This is not configurable in the URI, so this
must be overriden internally. Since mongocryptd is a local process, there should
only be a very short delay after spawning mongocryptd for it to start listening
on sockets. See the SDAM spec description of `cooldownMS <../source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst#cooldownms>`__.

Because single threaded drivers may exceed ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS`` by the
duration of the topology scan, ``connectTimeoutMS`` is also reduced.

What's the deal with metadataClient, keyVaultClient, and the internal client?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When automatically encrypting a command, the driver runs:
- a ``listCollections`` command to determine if the target collection
has a remote schema. This uses the ``metadataClient``.
- a ``find`` against the key vault collection to fetch keys. This uses the
``keyVaultClient``.

Why not reuse the parent MongoClient when maxPoolSize is limited?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These operations MUST NOT reuse the same connection pool as the parent
``MongoClient`` configured with automatic encryption to avoid possible deadlock
situations.

Drivers supporting a connection pool (see `CMAP specification
</source/connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.rst>`_)
support an option for limiting the connection pool size: ``maxPoolSize``.

Drivers need to check out a connection before serializing the command. If the
``listCollections`` or ``find`` command during automatic encryption uses the same
connection pool as the parent MongoClient, the application is susceptible to
deadlocks.

Using the same connection pool causes automatic encryption to check out multiple
connections from the pool when processing a single command. If maxPoolSize=1,
this is an immediate deadlock. If maxPoolSize=2, and two threads check out the
first connection, they will deadlock attempting to check out the second.

Why is keyVaultClient an exposed option, but metadataClient private?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``keyVaultClient`` supports the use case where the key vault collection is
stored on a MongoDB cluster separate from the data-bearing cluster.

The ``metadataClient`` is only used for ``listCollections`` against the
data-bearing cluster.

``listCollections`` responses are cached by libmongocrypt for one minute.

The use pattern of the ``metadataClient`` will likely greatly differ from
the parent ``MongoClient``. So it is configured with ``minPoolSize=0``.

The ``metadataClient`` is not an exposed option because a user could
misconfigure it to point to another MongoDB cluster, which could be a
security risk.

Why is the metadataClient not needed if bypassAutoEncryption=true
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

JSON schema data is only needed for automatic encryption but not for automatic
decryption. ``listCollections`` is not run when ``bypassAutoEncryption`` is
``true``, making a metadataClient unnecessary.

Why are commands sent to mongocryptd on collections without encrypted fields?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a ``MongoClient`` is configured with automatic encryption, all commands on
collections listed as ``AUTOENCRYPT`` in `libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption
Allow-List`_ undergo the automatic encryption process. Even if the collection
does not have an associated schema, the command is sent to mongocryptd as a
safeguard. A collection may not have encrypted fields, but a command on the
collection may could have sensitive data as part of the command arguments. For
example:

.. code::

   db.publicData.aggregate([
      {$lookup: {from: "privateData", localField: "_id", foreignField: "_id", as: "privateData"}},
      {$match: {"privateData.ssn": "123-45-6789"}},
   ])


The ``publicData`` collection does not have encrypted fields, but the
``privateData`` collection does. mongocryptd rejects an aggregate with
``$lookup`` since there is no mechanism to determine encrypted fields of joined
collections.

Why do KMS providers require TLS options?
-----------------------------------------

Drivers authenticate to KMIP servers with the client certificate presented in
TLS connections.

This specification assumes that TLS connections to KMIP servers may require
different TLS options than TLS connections to MongoDB servers.

KMIP support in the MongoDB server is a precedent. The server supports
``--kmipServerCAFile`` and ``--kmipClientCertificateFile`` to configure the
encrypted storage engine KMIP. See
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/.

TLS options may be useful for the AWS, Azure, and GCP KMS providers in
a case where the default trust store does not include the needed CA
certificates.

.. _fle2-and-fle1-error:

Why is it an error to have an FLE 1 and FLE 2 field in the same collection?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no technical limitation to having a separate FLE 1 field and FLE 2 field in the same collection. Prohibiting FLE 1 and FLE 2 in the same collection reduces complexity. From the product perspective, a random FLE 1 field and a non-queryable FLE 2 field have the same behavior and similar security guarantees. A deterministic FLE 1 field leaks more information then a deterministic FLE 2 field. There is not a compelling use case to use both FLE 1 and FLE 2 in the same collection.

Is it an error to set schemaMap and encryptedFieldsMap?
------------------------------------------------------------
No. FLE 1 and FLE 2 fields can coexist in different collections. The same collection cannot be in the ``encryptedFieldsMap`` and ``schemaMap``. libmongocrypt_ will error if the same collection is specified in a ``schemaMap`` and ``encryptedFieldsMap``.

Why is bypassQueryAnalysis needed?
----------------------------------

Commands containing payloads for encrypted indexed fields require a top-level "encryptionInformation" field for the server processing. ``bypassQueryAnalysis`` enables the use case of Explicit Encryption without the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced licensed csfle shared library or mongocryptd process.

Here is an example:

.. code:: go

   // No MongoDB Enterprise Advanced licensed 'csfle' shared library.
   aeo := options.AutoEncryption().
      SetKeyVaultNamespace("keyvault.datakeys").
      SetEncryptedFieldsMap(efcMap).
      SetKmsProviders(kmsProviders).
      SetBypassQueryAnalysis(true)

   co := options.Client().
      ApplyURI(uri).
      SetAutoEncryptionOptions(aeo)

   encryptedClient, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, co)
   defer encryptedClient.Disconnect(ctx)
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("error in Connect: %v", err)
   }

   coll := encryptedClient.Database("foo").Collection("bar")
   // Explicit Encrypt an FLE 2 Indexed Field.
   eo := options.Encrypt().
      SetEncryptIndexType(options.EncryptIndexEquality)
   ciphertext, err := ce.Encrypt(ctx, val, eo)
   // In InsertOne, libmongocrypt appends "encryptionInformation" to the insert command.
   _, err = coll.InsertOne(ctx, bson.D{{"encryptedIndexed", ciphertext}})
   if err != nil {
      log.Fatalf("error in InsertOne: %v", err)
   }

A rejected alternative to adding ``bypassQueryAnalysis`` is to change the behavior of ``bypassAutoEncryption``. ``bypassQueryAnalysis`` is distinct from ``bypassAutoEncryption``. ``bypassAutoEncryption`` bypasses all of libmongocrypt for commands. Changing the behavior of ``bypassAutoEncryption`` could harm performance (e.g. by serializing as smaller documents).

Why does rewrapManyDataKey return RewrapManyDataKeyResult instead of BulkWriteResult?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``rewrapManyDataKey`` is risky as it performs both a find and an update on the
key vault collection. Using ``RewrapManyDataKeyResult`` allows new fields to be
added in the future and more easily deprecate the wrapped ``BulkWriteResult`` if
necessary.

Why is there both a createKey and a createDataKey function in ClientEncryption?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

``createDataKey`` existed before ``createKey``, but ``createKey`` was added for
parity with the mongosh interface. ``createDataKey`` remains for backwards
compatibility.

Why does ClientEncryption have key management functions when Drivers can use existing CRUD operations instead?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The key management functions are added for parity with mongosh to reduce
friction between conducting operations using mongosh and a Driver. Their
inclusion assumes their value for users outweighs their cost of implementation
and maintenance.

Future work
===========

Make libmonogocrypt cache window configurable
---------------------------------------------
There's a principle at MongoDB, "no knobs", that we should honor
wherever possible. Configurability is bad, mandating one well-chosen
value is good. But if our default caching behavior is discovered
unsuitable for some use cases we may add configuration as part of future
work.

APM events for encryption or key service interaction
----------------------------------------------------
APM events include the encrypted data before it is sent to the server,
or before it is decrypted in a reply. Therefore, app developers can
determine whether or not encryption occurred by inspecting the values in
their command monitoring events. However, it might be useful to offer
separate "encryption" and "decryption" events, as well as interactions
with the key service.

Remove mongocryptd
------------------
A future version plans to remove the mongocryptd_ process and fold the logic
into `libmongocrypt` using the csfle_ library. Therefore, this spec mandates
that drivers use `libmongocrypt` to abstract encryption logic, deduplicate work,
and to provide a simpler future path to removing mongocryptd_.

Support external key vault collection discovery
-----------------------------------------------
The only way to configure an external key vault collection is by passing a
MongoClient.

For apps like Compass, where it may not be possible for users to
configure this app side, there should ideally be enough information in
the database to decrypt data. (Excluding KMS credentials, which are
still passed as MongoClient options).

We may want to store a URI to the external key vault collection somewhere
in the data bearing cluster, so clients can connect to the external key vault
collection without additional user supplied configuration.

Batch listCollections requests on expired schema cache entries
--------------------------------------------------------------

Currently libmongocrypt will refresh schemas one at a time.

Add a maximum size for the JSONSchema/key cache.
------------------------------------------------

They're unbounded currently.

Recalculate message size bounds dynamically
-------------------------------------------

Instead of using one reduced maxMessageSizeBytes, libmongocrypt could
hide the complexity of properly resplitting bulk writes after
encryption. It could use a simple back-off algorithm: try marking a
command with maxMessageSizeBytes=24MB. If after marking we determine
that's too large, try again with maxMessageSizeBytes=12MB and so on. And
in the end libmongocrypt would create multiple OP_MSGs to send.

Support sessions in key management functions
--------------------------------------------

Key management functions currently assume there are no concurrent accesses of
the key vault collection being operated on. To support concurrent access of the
key vault collection, the key management functions may be overloaded to take an
explicit session parameter as described in the
`Drivers Sessions Specification <../sessions/driver-sessions.rst>`__.

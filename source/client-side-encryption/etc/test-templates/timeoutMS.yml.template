  # Test that timeoutMS applies to the sum of all operations done for client-side encryption. This is done by blocking
  # listCollections and find for 10ms each and running an insertOne with timeoutMS=25. There should be two
  # listCollections commands and one "find" command, so the sum should take more than timeoutMS.
  #
  # This test does not include command monitoring expectations because the exact command sequence is dependent on the
  # amount of time taken by mongocryptd communication. In slow runs, mongocryptd communication can breach the timeout
  # and result in the final "find" not being sent.

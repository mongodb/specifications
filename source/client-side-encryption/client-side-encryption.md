# Client Side Encryption

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 4.2 (CSFLE), 6.0 (Queryable Encryption)
- Version: 1.14.0

______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

MongoDB 4.2 introduced support for client side encryption, guaranteeing that sensitive data can only be encrypted and
decrypted with access to both MongoDB and a separate key management provider (supporting AWS, Azure, GCP, a local
provider, and KMIP). Once enabled, data can be seamlessly encrypted and decrypted with minimal application code changes.
6.0 introduced the next generation of client side encryption based on a Structured Encryption framework which allows
expressive encrypted search operations. This spec covers both capabilities - 1st generation, "Client Side Field Level
Encryption" and generation 2, "Queryable Encryption" - as the associated core cryptographic library and supporting
drivers share a common codebase.

## META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Terms

**encrypted MongoClient**

A MongoClient with client side encryption enabled.

**data key**

A key used to encrypt and decrypt BSON values. Data keys are encrypted with a key management service (e.g. AWS KMS) and
stored within a document in the MongoDB key vault collection (see
[Key vault collection schema for data keys](#key-vault-collection-schema-for-data-keys) for a description of the data
key document). Therefore, a client needs access to both MongoDB and the external KMS service to utilize a data key.

**MongoDB key vault collection**

A MongoDB collection designated to contain data keys. This can either be co-located with the data-bearing cluster, or in
a separate external MongoDB cluster.

**Key Management Service (KMS)**

An external service providing fixed-size encryption/decryption. Only data keys are encrypted and decrypted with KMS.

**KMS providers**

> A map of KMS providers to credentials. Configured client-side. Example:
>
> ```python
> kms_providers = {
>    "aws": {
>       "accessKeyId": AWS_KEYID,
>       "secretAccessKey": AWS_SECRET,
>    },
>    "local": {
>       "key": LOCAL_KEK
>    },
> }
> ```

**KMS provider**

A configured KMS. Identified by a key in the KMS providers map. The key has the form "<KMS provider type>" or
"<KMS provider type>:<KMS
provider name>". Examples: "aws" or "aws:myname". In [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt), the key
is referred to as the KMS ID.

**KMS provider type**

The type of backing KMS. Identified by the string: "aws", "azure", "gcp", "kmip", or "local".

**KMS provider name**

An optional name to identify a KMS provider. Enables configuring multiple KMS providers with the same KMS provider type
(e.g. "aws:name1" and "aws:name2" can refer to different AWS accounts).

**Customer Master Key (CMK)**

The underlying key AWS KMS uses to encrypt and decrypt. See
[AWS Key Management Service Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#master_keys).

**schema**

A MongoDB JSON Schema (either supplied by the server or client-side) which may include metadata about encrypted fields.
This is a JSON Schema based on draft 4 of the JSON Schema specification,
[as documented in the MongoDB manual.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/).

**[libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt)**

A library, written in C, that coordinates communication, does encryption/decryption, caches key and schemas.
[Located here](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt).

**[mongocryptd](#mongocryptd)**

A local process the driver communicates with to determine how to encrypt values in a command.

**[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared)**

This term, spelled in all-lowercase with an underscore, refers to the client-side field-level-encryption dynamic library
provided as part of a MongoDB Enterprise distribution. It replaces [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) as the method of
[marking-up a database command for encryption](../bson-binary-encrypted/binary-encrypted.md#intent-to-encrypt).

See also:

> - [Introduction on crypt_shared](#crypt_shared)
> - [Enabling crypt_shared](#enabling-crypt_shared)

**ciphertext**

One of the data formats of [BSON binary encrypted](../bson-binary-encrypted/binary-encrypted.md), representing an
encoded BSON document containing encrypted ciphertext and metadata.

**FLE**

FLE is the first version of Client-Side Field Level Encryption. FLE is almost entirely client-side with the exception of
server-side JSON schema.

**Queryable Encryption**

Queryable Encryption the second version of Client-Side Field Level Encryption. Data is encrypted client-side. Queryable
Encryption supports indexed encrypted fields, which are further processed server-side.

**In-Use Encryption**

Is an umbrella term describing the both FLE and Queryable Encryption.

**encryptedFields**

A BSON document describing the Queryable Encryption encrypted fields. This is analogous to the JSON Schema in FLE. The
following is an example encryptedFields in extended canonical JSON:

```javascript
{
    "escCollection": "enxcol_.CollectionName.esc",
    "ecocCollection": "enxcol_.CollectionName.ecoc",
    "fields": [
        {
            "path": "firstName",
            "keyId": { "$binary": { "subType": "04", "base64": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==" }},
            "bsonType": "string",
            "queries": {"queryType": "equality"}
        },
        {
            "path": "ssn",
            "keyId": { "$binary": { "subType": "04", "base64": "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB==" }},
            "bsonType": "string"
        }
    ]
}
```

The acronyms within `encryptedFields` are defined as follows:

- ECOC: Encrypted Compaction Collection
- ESC: Encrypted State Collection

## Introduction

Client side encryption enables users to specify what fields in a collection must be encrypted, and the driver
automatically encrypts commands and decrypts results. Automatic encryption is enterprise only. But users can manually
encrypt and decrypt with a new ClientEncryption object.

Client side encryption requires MongoDB 4.2 compatible drivers, and is only supported against 4.2 or higher servers. See
[Why is a 4.2 server required?](#why-is-a-42-server-required).

The following shows basic usage of the new API.

```python
# The schema map identifies fields on collections that must undergo encryption.

schema_map = open("./schemas.json", "r").read()

# AWS KMS is used to decrypt data keys stored in the key vault collection.

aws_creds = open("./aws_credentials.json", "r").read()

# A client is configured for automatic encryption and decryption by passing
# AutoEncryptionOpts. Automatic encryption is an enterprise only feature.

opts = AutoEncryptionOpts(
    kms_providers={"aws": aws_creds},
    key_vault_namespace="db.datakeys",
    schema_map=schema_map)

db = MongoClient(auto_encryption_opts=opts).db

# Commands are encrypted, as determined by the JSON Schema from the schema_map.
db.coll.insert_one({"ssn": "457-55-5462"})

# Replies are decrypted.
print(db.coll.find_one()) # { "ssn": "457-55-5462" } but stored and transported as ciphertext.

# A ClientEncryption object is used for explicit encryption, decryption, and creating data keys.
opts = ClientEncryptionOpts(kms_providers=kms, key_vault_namespace="db.datakeys")
clientencryption = ClientEncryption(client, opts)

# Use a ClientEncryption to create new data keys.
# The master key identifies the CMK on AWS KMS to use for encrypting the data key.
master_key = open("./aws_masterkey.json", "r").read()
opts = DataKeyOpts (master_key=master_key)
created_key_id = clientencryption.create_data_key("aws", opts)

# Use a ClientEncryption to explicitly encrypt and decrypt.
opts = EncryptOpts(key_id=created_key_id,
    algorithm="AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random")
encrypted = clientencryption.encrypt("secret text", opts)
decrypted = clientencryption.decrypt(encrypted)
```

There are many moving parts to client side encryption with lots of similar sounding terms. Before proceeding to
implement the specification, the following background should provide some context.

The driver interacts with multiple components to implement client side encryption.

![image](includes/components.png)

The driver communicates withâ€¦

- **MongoDB cluster** to get remote JSON Schemas.
- **MongoDB key vault collection** to get encrypted data keys and create new data keys.
- **A KMS Provider** to decrypt fetched data keys and encrypt new data keys.
- **mongocryptd** to ask what values in BSON commands must be encrypted (unless [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is in
  use).

The MongoDB key vault may be the same as the MongoDB cluster. Users may choose to have data key stored on a separate
MongoDB cluster, or co-locate with their data.

### MongoDB Key Vault collection

The key vault collection is a special MongoDB collection containing key documents. See the appendix section
[Key vault collection schema for data keys](#key-vault-collection-schema-for-data-keys) for a description of the
documents.

The key material in the key vault collection is encrypted with a separate KMS service. Therefore, encryption and
decryption requires access to a MongoDB cluster and the KMS service.

### KMS Provider

A KMS provider (AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP KMS, the local provider, or KMIP) is used to decrypt data keys after
fetching from the MongoDB Key Vault, and encrypt newly created data keys. Refer to [KMSProviders](#kmsproviders) for the
shape of the KMS provider options.

### mongocryptd

`mongocryptd` is a singleton local process needed for auto-encryption when no [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library is
used. It speaks the MongoDB wire protocol and the driver uses [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) by connecting with a
MongoClient. By default, if [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is unavailable, the driver should attempt to automatically
spawn [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd). If the MongoClient is configured with `extraOptions.mongocryptdBypassSpawn` set to
`true`, OR `bypassAutoEncryption` is set to `true`, OR `bypassQueryAnalysis` is set to `true` then the driver will not
attempt to spawn [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd).

The [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) process is responsible for self terminating after idling for a time period. If
[extraOptions.cryptSharedLibRequired](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibrequired) is set to `true`, the driver will not
connect to [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) and instead rely on [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) being available.

### crypt_shared

[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is a dynamically-loaded C++ library providing query analysis for auto-encryption. It
replaces [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) for performing query analysis to -
[mark-up sensitive fields within a command](../bson-binary-encrypted/binary-encrypted.md#intent-to-encrypt).

Drivers are not required to load and interact with [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) directly. Instead, they inform
[libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) where to find [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) and [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will
handle [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) communication automatically.

See also: [Enabling crypt_shared](#enabling-crypt_shared) for information on using enabling the
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library.

### libmongocrypt

libmongocrypt is a C library providing crypto and coordination with external components.
[Located here](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt).

**libmongocrypt is responsible forâ€¦**

- orchestrating an internal state machine.
- asking the driver to perform I/O, then handling the responses.
  - includes constructing KMS HTTP requests and parsing KMS responses.
- doing encryption and decryption.
- caching data keys.
- caching results of listCollections.
- creating key material.

**The driver is responsible forâ€¦**

- performing all I/O needed at every state:
  - speaking to [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) to mark commands (unless [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is used).
  - fetching encrypted data keys from key vault collection (mongod).
  - running listCollections on mongod.
  - decrypting encrypted data keys with KMS over TLS.
- doing I/O asynchronously as needed.

See [Why require including a C library?](#why-require-including-a-c-library)

## User facing API

Drivers MUST NOT preclude future options from being added to any of the new interfaces.

Drivers MAY represent the options types in a way that is idiomatic to the driver or language. E.g. options MAY be a BSON
document or dictionary type. The driver MAY forego validating options and instead defer validation to the underlying
implementation.

Drivers MAY deviate the spelling of option names to conform to their language's naming conventions and implement options
in an idiomatic way (e.g. keyword arguments, builder classes, etc.).

Drivers MAY use a native UUID type in place of a parameter or return type specified as a BSON binary with subtype 0x04
as described in [Handling of Native UUID Types](../bson-binary-uuid/uuid.md).

### MongoClient Changes

<span id="MongoClient"></span>

```typescript
class MongoClient {
   MongoClient(... autoEncryptionOpts: AutoEncryptionOpts);

   // Implementation details.
   private mongocrypt_t libmongocrypt_handle; // Handle to libmongocrypt.
   private Optional<MongoClient> mongocryptd_client; // Client to mongocryptd.
   private MongoClient keyvault_client; // Client used to run find on the key vault collection. This is either an external MongoClient, the parent MongoClient, or internal_client.
   private MongoClient metadata_client; // Client used to run listCollections. This is either the parent MongoClient or internal_client.
   private Optional<MongoClient> internal_client; // An internal MongoClient. Created if no external keyVaultClient was set, or if a metadataClient is needed

   // Exposition-only, used for caching automatic Azure credentials. The cached credentials may be globally cached.
   private cachedAzureAccessToken?: AzureAccessToken;
   private azureAccessTokenExpireTime?: PointInTime;
}
```

<span id="AutoEncryptionOpts"></span>

```typescript
class AutoEncryptionOpts {
   keyVaultClient: Optional<MongoClient>;
   keyVaultNamespace: String;
   kmsProviders: KMSProviders;
   schemaMap: Optional<Map<String, Document>>; // Maps namespace to a local schema
   bypassAutoEncryption: Optional<Boolean>; // Default false.
   extraOptions: Optional<Map<String, Value>>;
   tlsOptions?: KMSProvidersTLSOptions; // Maps KMS provider to TLS options.
   encryptedFieldsMap: Optional<Map<String, Document>>; // Maps namespace to encryptedFields.
   // bypassQueryAnalysis disables automatic analysis of outgoing commands.
   // Set bypassQueryAnalysis to true to use explicit encryption on indexed fields
   // without the MongoDB Enterprise Advanced licensed crypt_shared library.
   bypassQueryAnalysis: Optional<Boolean>; // Default false.
}
```

A MongoClient can be configured to automatically encrypt collection commands and decrypt results.

Drivers MUST document that auto encryption is an enterprise-only feature and that auto encryption only occurs on
collection level operations by including the following in the driver documentation for AutoEncryptionOpts:

> Automatic encryption is an enterprise only feature that only applies to operations on a collection. Automatic
> encryption is not supported for operations on a database or view, and operations that are not bypassed will result in
> error (see [libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List](#libmongocrypt-auto-encryption-allow-list)). To bypass
> automatic encryption for all operations, set bypassAutoEncryption=true in AutoEncryptionOpts.

Explicit encryption/decryption and automatic decryption is a community feature. A MongoClient configured with
bypassAutoEncryption=true will still automatically decrypt.

Drivers MUST document that auto encryption requires the authenticated user to have the listCollections privilege action
by including the following in the driver documentation for MongoClient:

> Automatic encryption requires the authenticated user to have the
> [listCollections privilege action](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/listCollections/#dbcmd.listCollections).

See
[Why is client side encryption configured on a MongoClient?](#why-is-client-side-encryption-configured-on-a-mongoclient)

#### keyVaultNamespace

The key vault collection namespace refers to a collection that contains all data keys used for encryption and decryption
(aka the key vault collection). Data keys are stored as documents in a special MongoDB collection. Data keys are
protected with encryption by a KMS provider (AWS KMS, Azure key vault, GCP KMS, a local master key, or KMIP).

#### keyVaultClient

The key vault collection is assumed to reside on the same MongoDB cluster as indicated by the connecting URI. But the
optional keyVaultClient can be used to route data key queries to a separate MongoDB cluster.

If a `keyVaultClient` is not passed, and the parent `MongoClient` is configured with a limited `maxPoolSize`, the
`keyVaultClient` is set to an internal `MongoClient`. See
[keyVaultClient, metadataClient, and the internal MongoClient](#keyvaultclient-metadataclient-and-the-internal-mongoclient)
for configuration behavior.

See
[What's the deal with metadataClient, keyVaultClient, and the internal client?](#whats-the-deal-with-metadataclient-keyvaultclient-and-the-internal-client)

#### keyVaultClient, metadataClient, and the internal MongoClient

The following pseudo-code describes the configuration behavior for the three `MongoClient` objects:

```
def getOrCreateInternalClient (client, clientOpts):
   if client.internalClient != None:
      return client.internalClient
   internalClientOpts = copy(clientOpts)
   internalClientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts = None
   internalClientOpts.minPoolSize = 0
   client.internalClient = MongoClient (internalClientOpts)
   return client.internalClient

def configureAutoEncryptionClients (client, clientOpts):
   if clientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts.keyVaultClient != None:
      client.keyVaultClient = clientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts.keyVaultClient
   elif clientOpts.maxPoolSize == 0:
      client.keyVaultClient = client
   else:
      client.keyVaultClient = getOrCreateInternalClient (client, clientOpts)

   if clientOpts.autoEncryptionOpts.bypassAutomaticEncryption:
      client.metadataClient = None
   elif clientOpts.maxPoolSize == 0:
      client.metadataClient = client
   else:
      client.metadataClient = getOrCreateInternalClient (client, clientOpts)
```

Configuring the internal `MongoClient` MUST match the parent `MongoClient`, except `minPoolSize` is set to `0` and
`AutoEncryptionOpts` is omitted. This includes copying the options and host information from the URI, and other non-URI
configuration (monitoring callbacks, stable API, etc.).

Drivers MUST document that an additional `MongoClient` may be created, using the following as a template:

> If a `MongoClient` with a limited connection pool size (i.e a non-zero `maxPoolSize`) is configured with
> `AutoEncryptionOpts`, a separate internal `MongoClient` is created if any of the following are true:
>
> - `AutoEncryptionOpts.keyVaultClient` is not passed.
> - `AutoEncryptionOpts.bypassAutomaticEncryption` is `false`.
>
> If an internal `MongoClient` is created, it is configured with the same options as the parent `MongoClient` except
> `minPoolSize` is set to `0` and `AutoEncryptionOpts` is omitted.

<span id="GCPKMSOptions"></span> <span id="AWSKMSOptions"></span> <span id="KMSProvider"></span>
<span id="KMSProviders"></span> <span id="AzureAccessToken"></span> <span id="kmsproviders"></span>

#### kmsProviders

The `kmsProviders` property may be specified on [ClientEncryptionOpts](#ClientEncryptionOpts) or
[AutoEncryptionOpts](#AutoEncryptionOpts). Multiple KMS providers may be specified, each using a specific property on
the [KMSProviders](#kmsproviders) object. The options differ for each KMS provider type. The "local" KMS provider type
is configured with master key material. The external providers are configured with credentials to authenticate.

Throughout this document, the KMS provider is annotated as - `KMSProvider`, but this name is for *exposition only*:
drivers MUST accept arbitrary strings at runtime for forward-compatibility.

```typescript
interface KMSProviders {
   aws?: AWSKMSOptions | { /* Empty (See "Automatic Credentials") */ };
   azure?: AzureKMSOptions | { /* Empty (See "Automatic Credentials") */ };
   gcp?: GCPKMSOptions | { /* Empty (See "Automatic Credentials") */ };
   local?: LocalKMSOptions;
   kmip?: KMIPKMSOptions;

   // KMS providers may be specified with an optional name suffix separated by a colon.
   // Named KMS providers do not support "Automatic Credentials".
   // Note: the named KMS providers strings below are not valid Typescript regexes. They are intended for exposition only.
   "^aws:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"?: AWSKMSOptions;
   "^azure:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"?: AzureKMSOptions;
   "^gcp:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"?: GCPKMSOptions;
   "^local:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"?: LocalKMSOptions;
   "^kmip:[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"?: KMIPKMSOptions;
};

// KMSProvider is a string identifying a KMS provider. Note: For forward
// compatibility, any string should be accepted.
type KMSProvider = string;

interface AWSKMSOptions {
   accessKeyId: string;
   secretAccessKey: string;
   sessionToken?: string; // Required for temporary AWS credentials.
};

type AzureKMSOptions = AzureKMSCredentials | AzureAccessToken;

interface AzureKMSCredentials {
   tenantId: string;
   clientId: string;
   clientSecret: string;
   identityPlatformEndpoint?: string; // Defaults to login.microsoftonline.com
};

interface AzureAccessToken {
   accessToken: string;
};

type GCPKMSOptions = GCPKMSCredentials | GCPKMSAccessToken

interface GCPKMSCredentials {
   email: string;
   privateKey: byte[] | string; // May be passed as a base64 encoded string.
   endpoint?: string; // Defaults to oauth2.googleapis.com
};

interface GCPKMSAccessToken {
   accessToken: string;
}

interface LocalKMSOptions {
   key: byte[96] | string; // The master key used to encrypt/decrypt data keys. May be passed as a base64 encoded string.
};

interface KMIPKMSOptions {
   endpoint: string;
};
```

The following shows an example object of `KMSProviders`:

```yaml
{
   # Pass credentials for AWS:
   "aws": { "accessKeyId": "foo", "secretAccessKey": "bar" },
   # Use an empty document to enable "Automatic Credentials" for Azure:
   "azure": {},
   # Pass an access token for GCP:
   "gcp": { "accessToken": "foo" },
   # Pass a 96 byte base64 encoded string for the local KMS provider.
   "local": { "key": "Mng0NCt4ZHVUYUJCa1kxNkVyNUR1QURhZ2h2UzR2d2RrZzh0cFBwM3R6NmdWMDFBMUN3YkQ5aXRRMkhGRGdQV09wOGVNYUMxT2k3NjZKelhaQmRCZGJkTXVyZG9uSjFk" }
   # Pass the endpoint for KMIP:
   "kmip": { "endpoint": "localhost:5698" }
   # Pass credentials for a different AWS account by appending a name.
   # Note: credentials with a name do not support "Automatic Credentials".
   "aws:name2": { "accessKeyId": "foo2", "secretAccessKey": "bar2" }
}
```

<span id="automatic-credentials"></span>

##### Automatic Credentials

Certain values of [KMSProviders](#kmsproviders) indicate a request by the user that the associated KMS providers should
be populated lazily on-demand. The driver MUST be able to populate the respective options object on-demand
if-and-only-if such respective credentials are needed. The request for KMS credentials will be indicated by
[libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) only once they are needed.

When such a state is detected, [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will call back to the driver by entering the
`MONGOCRYPT_CTX_NEED_KMS_CREDENTIALS` state, upon which the driver should fill in the KMS options automatically.

Automatic credentials are only supported for the KMS provider types `aws`, `gcp`, and `azure`. KMS providers containing
a name (e.g. `aws:myname`) do not support automatic credentials. Attempting to configure a KMS provider with a name for
automatic credentials results in a runtime error from [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt). See
[Why do on-demand KMS credentials not support named KMS providers?](#why-do-on-demand-kms-credentials-not-support-named-kms-providers)

> [!NOTE]
> Drivers MUST NOT eagerly fill an empty KMS options property.

Once requested, drivers MUST create a new [KMSProviders](#kmsproviders) $P$ according to the following process:

1. Let $K$ be the [kmsProviders](#kmsproviders) value provided by the user as part of the original
   [ClientEncryptionOpts](#ClientEncryptionOpts) or [AutoEncryptionOpts](#AutoEncryptionOpts).
2. Initialize $P$ to an empty [KMSProviders](#kmsproviders) object.
3. If $K$ contains an `aws` property, and that property is an empty map:
   1. Attempt to obtain credentials $C$ from the environment using similar logic as is detailed in
      [the obtaining-AWS-credentials section from the Driver Authentication specification](../auth/auth.md#obtaining-credentials),
      but ignoring the case of loading the credentials from a URI
   2. If credentials $C$ were successfully loaded, create a new [AWSKMSOptions](#AWSKMSOptions) map from $C$ and insert
      that map onto $P$ as the `aws` property.
4. If $K$ contains an `gcp` property, and that property is an empty map:
   1. Attempt to obtain credentials $C$ from the environment logic as is detailed in
      [Obtaining GCP Credentials](#obtaining-gcp-credentials).
   2. If credentials $C$ were successfully loaded, create a new [GCPKMSOptions](#GCPKMSOptions) map from $C$ and insert
      that map onto $P$ as the `gcp` property.
5. If $K$ contains an `azure` property, and that property is an empty map:
   1. If there is a `cachedAzureAccessToken` AND the duration until `azureAccessTokenExpireTime` is greater than one
      minute, insert `cachedAzureAccessToken` as the `azure` property on $P$.
   2. Otherwise:
      1. Let $t_0$ be the current time.
      2. Attempt to obtain an Azure VM Managed Identity Access Token $T$ as detailed in
         [Obtaining an Access Token for Azure Key Vault](#obtaining-an-access-token-for-azure-key-vault).
      3. If a token $T$ with expire duration $d\_{exp}$ were obtained successfully, create a new
         [AzureAccessToken](#AzureAccessToken) object with $T$ as the `accessToken` property. Insert that
         [AzureAccessToken](#AzureAccessToken) object into $P$ as the `azure` property. Record the generated
         [AzureAccessToken](#AzureAccessToken) in `cachedAzureAccessToken`. Record the `azureAccessTokenExpireTime` as
         $t_0 + d\_{exp}$.
6. Return $P$ as the additional KMS providers to [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt).

<span id="obtaining-gcp-credentials"></span>

##### Obtaining GCP Credentials

Set `HOST` to `metadata.google.internal`.

Send an HTTP request to the URL `http://<HOST>/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token` with the
header `Metadata-Flavor: Google`.

If the HTTP response code is not 200, return an error including the body of the HTTP response in the error message.

Parse the HTTP response body as JSON. If parsing fails, return an error including the body of the HTTP response in the
error message.

Check the parsed JSON for the field "access_token". If "access_token" is not present, return an error including the body
of the HTTP response in the error message.

Return "access_token" as the credential.

##### Obtaining an Access Token for Azure Key Vault

Virtual machines running on the Azure platform have one or more *Managed Identities* associated with them. From within
the VM, an identity can be used by obtaining an access token via HTTP from the *Azure Instance Metadata Service* (IMDS).
[See this documentation for more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token#get-a-token-using-http)

> [!NOTE]
> To optimize for testability, it is recommended to implement an isolated abstraction for communication with IMDS. This
> will aide in the implementation of the prose tests of the communication with an IMDS server.

The below steps should be taken:

01. Let $U$ be a new URL, initialized from the URL string `"http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token"`

02. Add a query parameter `api-version=2018-02-01` to $U$.

03. Add a query parameter `resource=https://vault.azure.net/` to $U$.

04. Prepare an HTTP GET request $Req$ based on $U$.

    > [!NOTE]
    > All query parameters on $U$ should be appropriately percent-encoded

05. Add HTTP headers `Metadata: true` and `Accept: application/json` to $Req$.

06. Issue $Req$ to the Azure IMDS server `169.254.169.254:80`. Let $Resp$ be the response from the server. If the HTTP
    response is not completely received within ten seconds, consider the request to have timed out, and return an error
    instead of an access token.

07. If $Resp\_{status} â‰  200$, obtaining the access token has failed, and the HTTP response body of $Resp$ encodes
    information about the error that occurred. Return an error including the HTTP response body instead of an access
    token.

08. Otherwise, let $J$ be the JSON document encoded in the HTTP response body of $Resp$.

09. The result access token $T$ is given as the `access_token` string property of $J$. Return $T$ as the resulting
    access token.

10. The resulting "expires in" duration $d\_{exp}$ is a count of seconds given as an ASCII-encoded integer string
    `expires_in` property of $J$.

> [!NOTE]
> If JSON decoding of $Resp$ fails, or the `access_token` property is absent from $J$, this is a protocol error from
> IMDS. Indicate this error to the requester of the access token.

> [!NOTE]
> If an Azure VM has more than one managed identity, requesting an access token requires additional query parameters to
> disambiguate the request. For simplicity, these parameters are omitted, and only VMs that have a single managed
> identity are supported.

##### KMS provider TLS options

Drivers MUST provide TLS options to configure TLS connections KMS providers.

The TLS options SHOULD be consistent with the existing TLS options for MongoDB server TLS connections. The TLS options
MUST enable setting a custom client certificate, equivalent to the `tlsCertificateKeyFile` URI option.

Drivers SHOULD provide API that is consistent with configuring TLS options for MongoDB server TLS connections. New API
to support the TLS options MUST support future addition of KMS providers without requiring a driver API change. The
following is an example:

```typescript
class AutoEncryptionOpts {
   // setTLSOptions accepts a map of KMS providers to TLSOptions.
   // The TLSOptions apply to any TLS socket required to communicate
   // with the KMS provider.
   setTLSOptions (opts: KMSProvidersTLSOptions)
}

class ClientEncryptionOpts {
   // setTLSOptions accepts a map of KMS providers to TLSOptions.
   // The TLSOptions apply to any TLS socket required to communicate
   // with the KMS provider.
   setTLSOptions (opts: KMSProvidersTLSOptions)
}
```

Drivers MUST raise an error if the TLS options are set to disable TLS. The error MUST contain the message "TLS is
required".

Drivers SHOULD raise an error if insecure TLS options are set. The error MUST contain the message "Insecure TLS options
prohibited". This includes options equivalent to the following URI options:

- `tlsInsecure`
- `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`
- `tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`
- `tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck`

Drivers MUST NOT raise an error if `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck` is set. Setting `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck` may
prevent operation errors when OCSP responders are unresponsive.

See the OCSP specification for a description of the default values of
[tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck](../ocsp-support/ocsp-support.md#tlsdisableocspendpointcheck) and
[tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck](../ocsp-support/ocsp-support.md#tlsdisablecertificaterevocationcheck) Drivers
MUST NOT modify the default value of `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck` and `tlsDisableCertificateRevocationCheck` for KMS
TLS connections.

See [Why do KMS providers require TLS options?](#why-do-kms-providers-require-tls-options)

#### schemaMap

Automatic encryption is configured with an "encrypt" field in a collection's JSONSchema. By default, a collection's
JSONSchema is periodically polled with the listCollections command. But a JSONSchema may be specified locally with the
schemaMap option. Drivers MUST document that a local schema is more secure and MUST include the following in the driver
documentation for MongoClient:

> Supplying a schemaMap provides more security than relying on JSON Schemas obtained from the server. It protects
> against a malicious server advertising a false JSON Schema, which could trick the client into sending unencrypted data
> that should be encrypted.

Drivers MUST document that a local schema only applies to client side encryption, and specifying JSON Schema features
unrelated to encryption will result in error. Drivers MUST include the following in the driver documentation for
MongoClient:

> Schemas supplied in the schemaMap only apply to configuring automatic encryption for client side encryption. Other
> validation rules in the JSON schema will not be enforced by the driver and will result in an error.

#### bypassAutoEncryption

Drivers MUST disable auto encryption when the 'bypassAutoEncryption' option is true and not try to spawn mongocryptd.
Automatic encryption may be disabled with the bypassAutoEncryption option. See
[Why is there a bypassAutoEncryption?](#why-is-there-a-bypassautoencryption).

#### extraOptions

The extraOptions relate to the mongocryptd process, an implementation detail described in the
[Implementation](#implementation) section:

```typescript
{
   // Defaults to "mongodb://localhost:27020".
   mongocryptdURI: Optional<String>,

   // Defaults to false.
   mongocryptdBypassSpawn: Optional<Boolean>,

   // Used for spawning. Defaults to empty string and spawns mongocryptd from system path.
   mongocryptdSpawnPath: Optional<String>,

   // Passed when spawning mongocryptd. If omitted, this defaults to ["--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60"]
   mongocryptdSpawnArgs: Optional<Array[String]>

   // Override the path used to load the crypt_shared library
   cryptSharedLibPath: Optional<string>;

   // If 'true', refuse to continue encryption without a crypt_shared library
   cryptSharedLibRequired: boolean;
}
```

Drivers MUST implement extraOptions in a way that allows deprecating/removing options in the future without an API
break, such as with a BSON document or map type instead of a struct type with fixed fields. See
[Why are extraOptions and kmsProviders maps?](#why-are-extraoptions-and-kmsproviders-maps).

<span id="extraoptions.cryptsharedlibpath"></span>

##### `extraOptions.cryptSharedLibPath`

- Type: `undefined | string`
- Default: `undefined`

Allow the user to specify an absolute path to a [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) dynamic library to load. Refer:

- [Overriding the crypt_shared Library Path](#overriding-the-crypt_shared-library-path)
- [Path Resolution Behavior](#path-resolution-behavior)
- [Enabling crypt_shared](#enabling-crypt_shared)

<span id="extraoptions.cryptsharedlibrequired"></span>

##### `extraOptions.cryptSharedLibRequired`

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`

If `true`, the driver MUST refuse to continue unless [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) was loaded successfully.

If, after initializing a `libmongocrypt_handle`, [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is detected to be unavailable AND
[extraOptions.cryptSharedLibRequired](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibrequired) is `true`, the driver MUST consider the
`libmongocrypt_handle` to be invalid and return an error to the user. Refer:

<span id="managing-mongocryptd"></span> <span id="detecting-crypt_shared-availability"></span>

#### encryptedFieldsMap

`encryptedFieldsMap` maps a collection namespace to an `encryptedFields`.

`encryptedFieldsMap` only applies to Queryable Encryption.

If a collection is present on both the `encryptedFieldsMap` and `schemaMap`, [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will error
on initialization. See `fle2-and-fle1-error`.

If a collection has a set of encrypted fields, the behavior of `CreateCollection()` and `Collection.Drop()` is altered.
An additional helper, `CreateEncryptedCollection()` has been defined as a convenience wrapper around
`CreateCollection()`. See `fle2-createcollection-drop`.

Automatic encryption in Queryable Encryption is configured with the `encryptedFields`.

If a collection is not present on the `encryptedFields` a server-side collection `encryptedFields` may be used by
[libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt). Drivers MUST include the following in the documentation for MongoClient:

> Supplying an `encryptedFieldsMap` provides more security than relying on an `encryptedFields` obtained from the
> server. It protects against a malicious server advertising a false `encryptedFields`.

#### bypassQueryAnalysis

See [Why is bypassQueryAnalysis needed?](#why-is-bypassqueryanalysis-needed).

### Queryable Encryption Create and Drop Collection Helpers

A collection supporting Queryable Encryption requires an index and three additional collections.

<span id="GetEncryptedFields"></span>

#### Collection `encryptedFields` Lookup (GetEncryptedFields)

The convenience methods support the following lookup process for finding the `encryptedFields` associated with a
collection.

Assume an exposition-only function $GetEncryptedFields(opts, collName, dbName, askDb)$, where $opts$ is a set of
options, $collName$ is the name of the collection, $dbName$ is the name of the database associated with that collection,
and $askDb$ is a boolean value. The resulting `encryptedFields` $EF$ is found by:

1. Let $QualName$ be the string formed by joining$dbName$ and $collName$ with an ASCII dot `"."`.
2. If $opts$ contains an `"encryptedFields"` property, then $EF$ is the value of that property.
3. Otherwise, if `AutoEncryptionOptions.encryptedFieldsMap` contains an element named by $QualName$, then $EF$ is the
   value of that element.
4. Otherwise, if $askDb$ is `true`:
   1. Issue a `listCollections` command against the database named by $dbName$, filtered by `{name: <collName>}`. Let
      the result be the document $L$.
   2. If $L$ contains an `options` document element, and that element contains an `encryptedFields` document element,
      $EF$ is $L$ `["options"]["encryptedFields"]`.
   3. Otherwise, $EF$ is *not-found*
5. Otherwise, $EF$ is considered *not-found*.

<span id="create-collection-helper"></span>

#### Create Collection Helper

Drivers MUST support a BSON document option named `encryptedFields` for any
[create](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/create) command helpers (e.g.
`Database.createCollection()`). This option will be interpreted by the helper method and MUST be passed to the
[create](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/create) command.

> [!NOTE]
> Users are not expected to set the `escCollection` and `ecocCollection` options in `encryptedFields`.
> [SERVER-74069](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-74069) added server-side validation for those fields and no
> longer allows names to deviate from the following:
>
> - `enxcol_.<collectionName>.esc`
> - `enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecoc`
>
> Drivers MUST NOT document the `escCollection` and `ecocCollection` options.

For a helper function, `CreateCollection(collectionName, collectionOptions)` with the name of the database associated as
$dbName$, look up the encrypted fields `encryptedFields` for the collection as $GetEncryptedFields(collectionOptions,
collectionName, dbName, false)$ ([See here](#GetEncryptedFields)).

If a set of `encryptedFields` was found, then do the following operations. If any of the following operations error, the
remaining operations are not attempted:

- Check the wire version of the writable server. If the wire version is less than 21 (for server 7.0.0), return an error
  containing the error message: "Driver support of Queryable Encryption is incompatible with server. Upgrade server to
  use Queryable Encryption."
- Create the collection with name `encryptedFields["escCollection"]` as a clustered collection using the options
  `{clusteredIndex: {key: {_id: 1}, unique: true}}`. If `encryptedFields["escCollection"]` is not set, use the
  collection name `enxcol_.<collectionName>.esc`. Creating this collection MUST NOT check if the collection namespace is
  in the `AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap`. the collection namespace is in the
  `AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap`.
- Create the collection with name `encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]` as a clustered collection using the options
  `{clusteredIndex: {key: {_id: 1}, unique: true}}`. If `encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]` is not set, use the
  collection name `enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecoc`. Creating this collection MUST NOT check if the collection namespace
  is in the `AutoEncryptionOpts.encryptedFieldsMap`.
- Create the collection `collectionName` with `collectionOptions` and the option `encryptedFields` set to the
  `encryptedFields`.
- Create the the index `{"__safeContent__": 1}` on collection `collectionName`.

#### Create Encrypted Collection Helper

To support automatic generation of encryption data keys, a helper $CreateEncryptedCollection(CE, database, collName,
collOpts, kmsProvider, masterKey)$ is defined, where $CE$ is a [ClientEncryption](#clientencryption) object,
$kmsProvider$ is a [KMSProvider](#KMSProvider) and $masterKey$ is equivalent to the $masterKey$ defined in
[DataKeyOpts](#datakeyopts). It has the following behavior:

- If $collOpts$ contains an `"encryptedFields"` property, then $EF$ is the value of that property. Otherwise, report an
  error that there are no `encryptedFields` defined for the collection.
- Let $EF'$ be a copy of $EF$. Update $EF'$ in the following manner:
  - Let $Fields$ be the `"fields"` element within $EF'$.
  - If $Fields$ is present and is an array value, then for each element $F$ of `Fields`:
    - If $F$ is not a document element, skip it.
    - Otherwise, if $F$ has a `"keyId"` named element $K$ and $K$ is a `null` value:
      - Create a [DataKeyOpts](#datakeyopts) named $dkOpts$ with the $masterKey$ argument.
      - Let $D$ be the result of `CE.createDataKey(kmsProvider, dkOpts)`.
      - If generating $D$ resulted in an error $E$, the entire $CreateEncryptedCollection$ must now fail with error $E$.
        Return the partially-formed $EF'$ with the error so that the caller may know what datakeys have already been
        created by the helper.
      - Replace $K$ in $F$ with $D$.
- Create a new set of options $collOpts'$ duplicating $collOpts$. Set the `"encryptedFields"` named element of
  $collOpts'$ to $EF'$.
- Invoke the `CreateCollection` helper as $CreateCollection(database, collName, collOpts')$. Return the resulting
  collection and the generated $EF'$. If an error occurred, return the resulting $EF$ with the error so that the caller
  may know what datakeys have already been created by the helper.

Drivers MUST document that $createEncryptedCollection$ does not affect any auto encryption settings on existing
MongoClients that are already configured with auto encryption. Users must configure auto encryption after creating the
encrypted collection with the $createEncryptedCollection$ helper.

#### Drop Collection Helper

Drivers MUST support a BSON document option named `encryptedFields` for any
[drop](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/drop) command helpers (e.g. `Database.dropCollection()`,
`Collection.drop()`). This option will only be interpreted by the helper method and MUST NOT be passed to the
[drop](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/drop) command.

> [!NOTE]
> Users are not expected to set the `escCollection` and `ecocCollection` options in `encryptedFields`.
> [SERVER-74069](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-74069) added server-side validation for those fields and no
> longer allows names to deviate from the following:
>
> - `enxcol_.<collectionName>.esc`
> - `enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecoc`
>
> Drivers SHOULD NOT document the `escCollection` and `ecocCollection` options.

For a helper function `DropCollection(dropOptions)` with associated collection named $collName$ and database named
$dbName$, look up the encrypted fields `encryptedFields` as $GetEncryptedFields(dropOptions, collName, dbname, true)$
([See here](#GetEncryptedFields)).

If a set of `encryptedFields` was found, then perform the following operations. If any of the following operations
error, the remaining operations are not attempted. A `namespace not found` error returned from the server (server error
code 26) MUST be ignored:

- Drop the collection with name `encryptedFields["escCollection"]`. If `encryptedFields["escCollection"]` is not set,
  use the collection name `enxcol_.<collectionName>.esc`.
- Drop the collection with name `encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]`. If `encryptedFields["ecocCollection"]` is not set,
  use the collection name `enxcol_.<collectionName>.ecoc`.
- Drop the collection `collectionName`.

### ClientEncryption

```typescript
class ClientEncryption {
   ClientEncryption(opts: ClientEncryptionOpts);

   // The "Create Encrypted Collection" helper is a convenience function wrapping CreateCollection. It will
   // create a collection with encrypted fields, automatically allocating and assigning new data encryption
   // keys. It returns a handle to the new collection, as well as a document consisting of the generated
   // "encryptedFields" options. Refer to "Create Encrypted Collection Helper"
   createEncryptedCollection(database: Database, collName: string, collOpts, kmsProvider: KMSProvider, masterKey: Optional<Document>): [Collection, Document];

   // Creates a new key document and inserts into the key vault collection.
   // Returns the _id of the created document as a UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
   createDataKey(kmsProvider: KMSProvider, opts: DataKeyOpts | null): Binary;

   // Decrypts multiple data keys and (re-)encrypts them with a new masterKey, or with their current masterKey if a new one is not given.
   // The updated fields of each rewrapped data key is updated in the key vault collection as part of a single bulk write operation.
   // If no data key matches the given filter, no bulk write operation is executed.
   // Returns a RewrapManyDataKeyResult.
   rewrapManyDataKey(filter: Document, opts: RewrapManyDataKeyOpts | null): RewrapManyDataKeyResult;

   // Removes the key document with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04) from the key vault collection.
   // Returns the result of the internal deleteOne() operation on the key vault collection.
   deleteKey(id: Binary): DeleteResult;

   // Finds a single key document with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
   // Returns the result of the internal find() operation on the key vault collection.
   getKey(id: Binary): Optional<Document>;

   // Finds all documents in the key vault collection.
   // Returns the result of the internal find() operation on the key vault collection.
   getKeys(): Iterable<Document>;

   // Adds a keyAltName to the keyAltNames array of the key document in the key vault collection with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
   // Returns the previous version of the key document.
   addKeyAltName(id: Binary, keyAltName: String): Optional<Document>;

   // Removes a keyAltName from the keyAltNames array of the key document in the key vault collection with the given UUID (BSON binary subtype 0x04).
   // Returns the previous version of the key document.
   removeKeyAltName(id: Binary, keyAltName: String): Optional<Document>;

   // Returns a key document in the key vault collection with the given keyAltName.
   getKeyByAltName(keyAltName: String): Optional<Document>;

   // Encrypts a BsonValue with a given key and algorithm.
   // Returns an encrypted value (BSON binary of subtype 6). The underlying implementation MAY return an error for prohibited BSON values.
   encrypt(value: BsonValue, opts: EncryptOpts): Binary;

   // encryptExpression encrypts a Match Expression or Aggregate Expression to query a range index.
   // `expr` is expected to be a BSON document of one of the following forms:
   // 1. A Match Expression of this form:
   //   {$and: [{<field>: {$gt: <value1>}}, {<field>: {$lt: <value2> }}]}
   // 2. An Aggregate Expression of this form:
   //   {$and: [{$gt: [<fieldpath>, <value1>]}, {$lt: [<fieldpath>, <value2>]}]
   // $gt may also be $gte. $lt may also be $lte.
   // Only supported when queryType is "range" and algorithm is "Range".
   encryptExpression(expr: Document, opts: EncryptOpts): Document;

   // Decrypts an encrypted value (BSON binary of subtype 6).
   // Returns the original BSON value.
   decrypt(value: Binary): BsonValue;

   // Implementation details.
   private mongocrypt_t libmongocrypt_handle;
   private MongoClient keyvault_client;
}
```

<span id="ClientEncryptionOpts"></span>

<span id="KMSProvidersTLSOptions"></span>

```typescript
interface ClientEncryptionOpts {
   keyVaultClient: MongoClient;
   keyVaultNamespace: String;
   kmsProviders: KMSProviders;
   tlsOptions?: KMSProvidersTLSOptions; // Maps KMS provider to TLS options.
};

interface KMSProvidersTLSOptions {
   // Map the KMS providers to a set of TLS options
   [provider: KMSProvider]: TLSOptionsMap;
};
```

The ClientEncryption encapsulates explicit operations on a key vault collection that cannot be done directly on a
MongoClient. Similar to configuring auto encryption on a MongoClient, it is constructed with a MongoClient (to a MongoDB
cluster containing the key vault collection), KMS provider configuration, keyVaultNamespace, and tlsOptions. It provides
an API for explicitly encrypting and decrypting values, and managing data keys in the key vault collection.

See
[Why do we have a separate top level type for ClientEncryption?](#why-do-we-have-a-separate-top-level-type-for-clientencryption)
and
[Why do we need to pass a client to create a ClientEncryption?](#why-do-we-need-to-pass-a-client-to-create-a-clientencryption)

When implementing behavior and error handling for key vault functions, Drivers SHOULD assume the presence of a unique
index in the key vault collection on the `keyAltNames` field with a partial index filter for only documents where
`keyAltNames` exists when implementing behavior of key management functions. Drivers MAY choose to not validate or
enforce the existence of the unique index, but MUST still be capable of handling errors that such a unique index may
yield.

See
[Why aren't we creating a unique index in the key vault collection?](#why-arent-we-creating-a-unique-index-in-the-key-vault-collection)

### DataKeyOpts

```typescript
class DataKeyOpts {
   masterKey: Optional<Document>
   keyAltNames: Optional<Array[String]> // An alternative to _id to reference a key.
   keyMaterial: Optional<BinData>
}
```

#### masterKey

The masterKey document identifies a KMS-specific key used to encrypt the new data key. If kmsProvider has KMS provider
type "aws", the masterKey is required and has the following fields:

```typescript
{
   region: String,
   key: String, // The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to the AWS customer master key (CMK).
   endpoint: Optional<String> // An alternate host identifier to send KMS requests to. May include port number. Defaults to "kms.<region>.amazonaws.com"
}
```

If the kmsProvider has KMS provider type "azure", the masterKey is required and has the following fields:

```typescript
{
   keyVaultEndpoint: String, // Host with optional port. Example: "example.vault.azure.net".
   keyName: String,
   keyVersion: Optional<String> // A specific version of the named key, defaults to using the key's primary version.
}
```

If the kmsProvider has KMS provider type "gcp", the masterKey is required and has the following fields:

```typescript
{
   projectId: String,
   location: String,
   keyRing: String,
   keyName: String,
   keyVersion: Optional<String>, // A specific version of the named key, defaults to using the key's primary version.
   endpoint: Optional<String> // Host with optional port. Defaults to "cloudkms.googleapis.com".
}
```

If the kmsProvider has KMS provider type "local", the masterKey is not applicable.

If the kmsProvider has KMS provider type "kmip", the masterKey is required and has the following fields:

```javascript
{
   keyId: Optional<String>, // keyId is the KMIP Unique Identifier to a 96 byte KMIP Secret Data managed object.
                            // If keyId is omitted, the driver creates a random 96 byte KMIP Secret Data managed object.
   endpoint: Optional<String>, // Host with optional port.
   delegated: Optional<Boolean> // If true, this key should be decrypted by the KMIP server.
}
```

Drivers MUST document the expected fields in the masterKey document for the "aws", "azure", "gcp", and "kmip" KMS
provider types. Additionally, they MUST document that masterKey is **required** for these KMS provider types and is not
optional.

The value of `endpoint` or `keyVaultEndpoint` is a host name with optional port number separated by a colon. E.g.
"kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com" or "kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:443". It is assumed that the host name is not an IP
address or IP literal. Though drivers MUST NOT inspect the value of "endpoint" that a user sets when creating a data
key, a driver will inspect it when connecting to KMS to determine a port number if present.

#### keyAltNames

An optional list of string alternate names used to reference a key. If a key is created with alternate names, then
encryption may refer to the key by the unique alternate name instead of by `_id`. The following example shows creating
and referring to a data key by alternate name:

```python
opts = DataKeyOpts(keyAltNames=["name1"])
clientencryption.create_data_key ("local", opts)
# reference the key with the alternate name
opts = EncryptOpts(keyAltName="name1", algorithm="AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random")
clientencryption.encrypt("457-55-5462", opts)
```

#### keyMaterial

An optional BinData of 96 bytes to use as custom key material for the data key being created. If `keyMaterial` is given,
the custom key material is used for encrypting and decrypting data. Otherwise, the key material for the new data key is
generated from a cryptographically secure random device.

### rewrapManyDataKey

If applicable, drivers MUST document that users must upgrade dependencies if necessary to avoid being impacted by
[MONGOCRYPT-464](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/MONGOCRYPT-464).

If applicable, drivers MUST return an error if rewrapManyDataKey is called with libmongocrypt 1.5.1 or 1.5.0.

### RewrapManyDataKeyOpts

```typescript
class RewrapManyDataKeyOpts {
   provider: String
   masterKey: Optional<Document>
}
```

The `masterKey` document MUST have the fields corresponding to the given `provider` as specified in
[masterKey](#masterkey). `masterKey` MUST NOT be given if it is not applicable for the given `provider`.

### RewrapManyDataKeyResult

```typescript
class RewrapManyDataKeyResult {
   bulkWriteResult: Optional<BulkWriteResult>;
}
```

`bulkWriteResult` is the [result of the bulk write operation](../crud/crud.md#write-results) used to update the key
vault collection with one or more rewrapped data keys. If `rewrapManyDataKey()` does not find any matching keys to
rewrap, no bulk write operation will be executed and this field will be unset. This field may also be unset if the bulk
write operation is unacknowledged as permitted by the [CRUD API Spec](../crud/crud.md#write-results).

See
[Why does rewrapManyDataKey return RewrapManyDataKeyResult instead of BulkWriteResult?](#why-does-rewrapmanydatakey-return-rewrapmanydatakeyresult-instead-of-bulkwriteresult)

### EncryptOpts

```typescript
class EncryptOpts {
   keyId : Optional<Binary>
   keyAltName: Optional<String>
   algorithm: String,
   contentionFactor: Optional<Int64>,
   queryType: Optional<String>
   rangeOpts: Optional<RangeOpts>
}

// RangeOpts specifies index options for a Queryable Encryption field supporting "range" queries.
// min, max, trimFactor, sparsity, and precision must match the values set in the encryptedFields of the destination collection.
// For double and decimal128, min/max/precision must all be set, or all be unset.
class RangeOpts {
   // min is the minimum value for the encrypted index. Required if precision is set.
   min: Optional<BSONValue>,
   // max is the maximum value for the encrypted index. Required if precision is set.
   max: Optional<BSONValue>,
   // trimFactor may be used to tune performance. When omitted, a default value is used.
   trimFactor: Optional<Int32>,
   // sparsity may be used to tune performance. When omitted, a default value is used.
   sparsity: Optional<Int64>,
   // precision determines the number of significant digits after the decimal point. May only be set for double or decimal128.
   precision: Optional<Int32>
}
```

Explicit encryption requires a key and algorithm. Keys are either identified by `_id` or by alternate name. Exactly one
is required.

#### keyId

Identifies a data key by `_id`. The value is a UUID (binary subtype 4).

#### keyAltName

Identifies a key vault collection document by 'keyAltName'.

#### algorithm

One of the strings:

- "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
- "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random"
- "Indexed"
- "Unindexed"
- "Range"

The result of explicit encryption with the "Indexed" or "Range" algorithm must be processed by the server to insert or
query. Drivers MUST document the following behavior:

> To insert or query with an "Indexed" or "Range" encrypted payload, use a `MongoClient` configured with
> `AutoEncryptionOpts`. `AutoEncryptionOpts.bypassQueryAnalysis` may be true. `AutoEncryptionOpts.bypassAutoEncryption`
> must be false.

#### contentionFactor

contentionFactor may be used to tune performance. Only applies when algorithm is "Indexed" or "Range". libmongocrypt
returns an error if contentionFactor is set for a non-applicable algorithm.

#### queryType

One of the strings:

- "equality"
- "range"

queryType only applies when algorithm is "Indexed" or "Range". libmongocrypt returns an error if queryType is set for a
non-applicable queryType.

#### rangeOpts

rangeOpts only applies when algorithm is "Range". libmongocrypt returns an error if rangeOpts is set for a
non-applicable algorithm.

## User facing API: When Auto Encryption Fails

Auto encryption requires parsing the MongoDB query language client side (with the [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) process or
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library). For unsupported operations, an exception will propagate to prevent the
possibility of the client sending unencrypted data that should be encrypted. Drivers MUST include the following in the
documentation for MongoClient:

> If automatic encryption fails on an operation, use a MongoClient configured with bypassAutoEncryption=true and use
> ClientEncryption.encrypt() to manually encrypt values.

For example, currently an aggregate with `$lookup` into a foreign collection is unsupported ([mongocryptd](#mongocryptd)
and [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) return errors):

```python
opts = AutoEncryptionOpts (
   key_vault_namespace="keyvault.datakeys",
   kms_providers=kms)
client = MongoClient(auto_encryption_opts=opts)
accounts = client.db.accounts
results = accounts.aggregate([
   {
      "$lookup": {
      "from": "people",
      "pipeline": [
         {
            "$match": {
               "ssn": "457-55-5462"
            }
         }
      ],
      "as": "person"
   }
]) # Raises an error

print (next(results)["person"]["ssn"])
```

In this case, the user should use explicit encryption on a client configured to bypass auto encryption. (Note, automatic
decryption still occurs).

```python
opts = AutoEncryptionOpts (
   key_vault_namespace="keyvault.datakeys",
   kms_providers=kms,
   bypass_auto_encryption=True)
client = MongoClient(auto_encryption_opts=opts)

opts = ClientEncryptionOpts (
   key_vault_client=client,
   key_vault_namespace="keyvault.datakeys",
   kms_providers=kms,
   bypass_auto_encryption=True)
client_encryption = ClientEncryption(opts)

accounts = client.db.accounts
results = accounts.aggregate([
   {
      "$lookup": {
      "from": "people",
      "pipeline": [
         {
            "$match": {
               "ssn": client_encryption.encrypt("457-55-5462", EncryptOpts(key_alt_name="ssn", algorithm="AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"))
            }
         }
      ],
      "as": "person"
   }
]) # Throws an exception

print (next(results)["person"]["ssn"])
```

## User facing API: View limitations

Users cannot use auto encryption with views. Attempting to do so results in an exception. Drivers do not need to
validate when the user is attempting to enable auto encryption on a view, but may defer to the underlying
implementation.

Although auto encryption does not work on views, users may still use explicit encrypt and decrypt functions on views on
a MongoClient without auto encryption enabled.

See [Why do operations on views fail?](#why-do-operations-on-views-fail)

## Implementation

Drivers MUST integrate with libmongocrypt. libmongocrypt exposes a simple state machine to perform operations. Follow
[the guide to integrating libmongocrypt](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/integrating.md).

Drivers SHOULD take a best-effort approach to store sensitive data securely when interacting with KMS since responses
may include decrypted data key material (e.g. use secure malloc if available).

All errors from the MongoClient to [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) or the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) error category MUST
be distinguished in some way (e.g. exception type) to make it easier for users to distinguish when a command fails due
to auto encryption limitations.

All errors from the MongoClient interacting with the key vault collection MUST be distinguished in some way (e.g.
exception type) to make it easier for users to distinguish when a command fails due to behind-the-scenes operations
required for encryption, decryption, or key management.

Drivers MUST apply timeouts to operations executed as part of client-side encryption per
[Client Side Operations Timeout: Client Side Encryption](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md#client-side-encryption).

## Integrating with libmongocrypt

Each ClientEncryption instance MUST have one `libmongocrypt_handle`.

[The libmongocrypt C API documentation](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/src/mongocrypt.h) For
information on how to initialize, encrypt, decrypt with libmongocrypt.

[The Guide to Integrating libmongocrypt](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/integrating.md) For
information about integrating the libmongocrypt library in a driver.

libmongocrypt exposes logging capabilities. If a driver provides a logging mechanism, it MUST enable this logging and
integrate. E.g. if your driver exposes a logging callback that a user can set, it SHOULD be possible to get log messages
from libmongocrypt.

Drivers MUST propagate errors from libmongocrypt in whatever way is idiomatic to the driver (exception, error object,
etc.). These errors MUST be distinguished in some way (e.g. exception type) to make it easier for users to distinguish
when a command fails due to client side encryption.

<span id="enabling-crypt_shared"></span>

## Enabling Command Marking with the `crypt_shared` Library

The MongoDB Enterprise distribution includes a dynamic library named `mongo_crypt_v1` (with the appropriate file
extension or filename suffix for the host platform). This library will be loaded by [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) when
the `mongocrypt_init` function is invoked
[(from the libmongocrypt C API)](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/src/mongocrypt.h) based on the
search criteria that are provided by the driver.

[libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) allows the driver to specify an arbitrary list of directory
[search paths](#search-paths) in which to search for the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) dynamic library. The user-facing
API does not expose this full search path functionality. This extended search path customization is intended to
facilitate driver testing with [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) (Refer:
[Search Paths for Testing](#search-paths-for-testing) and [Path Resolution Behavior](#path-resolution-behavior)).

> [!NOTE]
> The driver MUST NOT manipulate or do any validation on the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) path options provided in
> [extraOptions](#extraoptions). They should be passed through to [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) unchanged.

<span id="search-path"></span> <span id="search-paths"></span>

### Setting Search Paths

For the user-facing API the driver MUST append the literal string - `"$SYSTEM"` to the search paths for the
`libmongocrypt_handle` if `bypassAutoEncryption` is not set to `true`, and MUST NOT append to the search path if it is
set to `true` or if the [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) instance is used for explicit encryption only (i.e. on the
ClientEncryption class). For purposes of testing, a driver may use a different set of search paths.

**Explanation**

The [search paths](#search-paths) array in [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) allows the driver to customize the way that
[libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) searches and loads the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library. For testing purposes, the
driver may change the paths that it appends for [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) searching to better isolate the test
execution from the ambient state of the host system.

Refer to: [Path Resolution Behavior](#path-resolution-behavior) and
[Search Paths for Testing](#search-paths-for-testing)

<span id="override-path"></span>

### Overriding the `crypt_shared` Library Path

If [extraOptions.cryptSharedLibPath](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibpath) was specified by the user, the driver MUST set
the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) path override on the `libmongocrypt_handle`.

> [!NOTE]
> If a path override is set on a `libmongocrypt_handle` and [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) fails to load
> [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) from that filepath, then that will result in a hard-error when initializing
> [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt).

### Path Resolution Behavior

Drivers should include and note the following information regarding the behavior of [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) path
options in [extraOptions](#extraoptions):

- If used, the [override path](#override-path) must be given as a path to the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) dynamic
  library file *itself*, and not simply the directory that contains it.

- If the given [override path](#override-path) is a relative path and the first path component is the literal string
  `"$ORIGIN"`, the `"$ORIGIN"` component will be replaced by the absolute path to the directory containing the
  [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) library that is performing the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) search. This behavior
  mimics the `$ORIGIN` behavior of the `RUNPATH`/`RPATH` properties of ELF executable files. This permits bundling the
  [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library along with [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) for creating portable application
  distributions without relying on a externally/globally available [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library.

  > [!NOTE]
  > No other `RPATH`/`RUNPATH`-style substitutions are available.

- If the [override path](#override-path) is given as a relative path, that path will be resolved relative to the working
  directory of the operating system process.

- If an [override path](#override-path) was specified and [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) fails to load
  [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) from that filepath, [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will fail to initialize with a
  hard-error. [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will not attempt to search for [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) in any other
  locations.

- If [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) fails to load the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library after searching the system
  (and no [override path](#override-path) is specified), [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will proceed without error and
  presume that [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is unavailable.

#### Search Paths for Testing

Drivers can make use of different [search paths](#search-paths) settings for testing purposes. These search paths use
the following behavior:

- For [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) [search paths](#search-paths), if a search path string is `"$SYSTEM"`, then â€”
  instead of [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) searching for [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) in a directory named
  "`$SYSTEM`" â€” [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will defer to the operating system's own dynamic-library resolution
  mechanism when processing that search-path. For this reason, `"$SYSTEM"` is the only search path appended when the
  driver is used via the user-facing API.

- The [search paths](#search-paths) also support the `$ORIGIN` substitution string.

- Like with the [override path](#override-path), if a [search path](#search-path) is given as a relative path, that path
  will be resolved relative to the working directory of the operating system process.

- If no [search paths](#search-paths) are appended to the `libmongocrypt_handle`, the resulting search paths will be an
  empty array, effectively [disabling crypt_shared](#disabling-crypt_shared) searching.

  In this case, unless an [override path](#override-path) is specified, [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) is guaranteed
  not to load [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared).

### Detecting [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) Availability

[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) availability can only be reliably detected *after* initializing the
`libmongocrypt_handle`.

After initializing the `libmongocrypt_handle`, the driver can detect whether [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) was
successfully loaded by asking [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) for the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) version string. If
the result is an empty string, [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) did not load [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) and the driver
must rely on [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) to mark command documents for encryption.

<span id="disabling-crypt_shared"></span>

### "Disabling" `crypt_shared`

For purposes of testing, a driver can "disable" [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) searching to ensure that
[mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) is used instead, even if a [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library would be available.

As noted in [Path Resolution Behavior](#path-resolution-behavior), [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) can be "disabled" on a
`libmongocrypt_handle` by omission:

1. Do not specify any [search paths](#search-paths),
2. AND do not specify a [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library [override path](#override-path)
   ([extraOptions.cryptSharedLibPath](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibpath)).

This will have the effect that [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will not attempt to search or load
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) during initialization.

At the current time, no user-facing API is exposed that allows users to opt-out of [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared).

### Loading [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) Multiple Times

Due to implementation restrictions, there must not be more than one [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) dynamic library loaded
simultaneously in a single operating system process. `libmongocrypt` will do its best to enforce this at the time that
it loads [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) while initializing a `libmongocrypt_handle`. `libmongocrypt` will keep track of
the open [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library globally, and any subsequent attempt to use a
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library that does not exactly match the filepath of the already-loaded
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) will result in an error.

If at least one `libmongocrypt_handle` exists in an operating system process that has an open handle to a
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library, subsequent attempts to initialize an additional `libmongocrypt_handle` will fail
if:

1. The new `libmongocrypt_handle` wants [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) (i.e. at least one [search path](#search-path) was
   specified or an [override path](#override-path) was specified).
2. AND the initialization of that `libmongocrypt_handle` does not successfully find and load the same
   [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library that was loaded by the existing `libmongocrypt_handle` that is already using
   [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared).

Drivers MUST document this limitation for users along with the documentation on the `cryptShared*` options in
[extraOptions](#extraoptions) by including the following:

> All `MongoClient` objects in the same process should use the same setting for
> [extraOptions.cryptSharedLibPath](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibpath), as it is an error to load more that one
> [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) dynamic library simultaneously in a single operating system process.

Once all open handles to a [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library are closed, it is possible to load a different
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library than was previously loaded. The restriction only applies to simultaneous open
handles within a single process.

## Managing mongocryptd

If the following conditions are met:

- The user's `MongoClient` is configured for client-side encryption (i.e. `bypassAutoEncryption` is not `false`)
- **AND** the user has not disabled `mongocryptd` spawning (i.e. by setting `extraOptions.mongocryptdBypassSpawn` to
  `true`),
- **AND** the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library is unavailable (Refer:
  [Detecting crypt_shared Availability](#detecting-crypt_shared-availability)),
- **AND** the [extraOptions.cryptSharedLibRequired](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibrequired) option is `false`.

**then** `mongocryptd` MUST be spawned by the driver.

If the [extraOptions.cryptSharedLibRequired](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibrequired) option is `true` then the driver MUST
NOT attempt to spawn or connect to `mongocryptd`.

> [!NOTE]
> Since spawning [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) requires checking whether [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is loaded, and
> checking whether [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is available can only be done *after* having initialized the
> `libmongocrypt_handle`, drivers will need to defer spawning [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) until *after* initializing
> [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) and checking for [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared).

### Spawning [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd)

If a MongoClient is configured for Client Side Encryption (eg. `bypassAutoEncryption=false`), then by default (unless
`mongocryptdBypassSpawn=true`), mongocryptd MUST be spawned by the driver. Spawning MUST include the command line
argument `--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs`. If the user does not supply one through `extraOptions.mongocryptdSpawnArgs` (which
may be either in the form `--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60` or as two consecutive arguments
`["--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs", 60]`, then the driver MUST append `--idleShutdownTimeoutSecs=60` to the arguments. This
tells mongocryptd to automatically terminate after 60 seconds of non-use. The stdout and stderr of the spawned process
MUST not be exposed in the driver (e.g. redirect to `/dev/null`). Users can pass the argument `--logpath` to
`extraOptions.mongocryptdSpawnArgs` if they need to inspect mongocryptd logs.

Upon construction, the MongoClient MUST create a MongoClient to mongocryptd configured with
`serverSelectionTimeoutMS=10000`.

If spawning is necessary, the driver MUST spawn mongocryptd whenever server selection on the MongoClient to mongocryptd
fails. If the MongoClient fails to connect after spawning, the server selection error is propagated to the user.

### Connecting to [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd)

If the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library is loaded, the driver MUST NOT attempt to connect to
[mongocryptd](#mongocryptd). (Refer: [Detecting crypt_shared Availability](#detecting-crypt_shared-availability)).

Single-threaded drivers MUST connect with
[serverSelectionTryOnce=false](../server-selection/server-selection.md#serverselectiontryonce),
`connectTimeoutMS=10000`, and MUST bypass
[cooldownMS](../server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.md#cooldownms) when connecting to mongocryptd. See
[Why are serverSelectionTryOnce and cooldownMS disabled for single-threaded drivers connecting to mongocryptd?](#why-are-serverselectiontryonce-and-cooldownms-disabled-for-single-threaded-drivers-connecting-to-mongocryptd)

If the ClientEncryption is configured with `mongocryptdBypassSpawn=true`, then the driver is not responsible for
spawning mongocryptd. If server selection ever fails when connecting to mongocryptd, the server selection error is
propagated to the user.

> [!NOTE]
> A correctly-behaving driver will never attempt to connect to [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) when
> [extraOptions.cryptSharedLibRequired](#extraoptions.cryptsharedlibrequired) is set to `true` or
> [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) is loaded.

## ClientEncryption

The new ClientEncryption type interacts uses libmongocrypt to perform ClientEncryption operations. See the
[libmongocrypt API documentation](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/src/mongocrypt.h) for more
information.

The ClientEncryption contains a MongoClient connected to the MongoDB cluster containing the key vault collection. It
does not contain a MongoClient to mongocryptd.

See
[Why does ClientEncryption have key management functions when Drivers can use existing CRUD operations instead?](#why-does-clientencryption-have-key-management-functions-when-drivers-can-use-existing-crud-operations-instead).

## Key Vault collection

The key vault collection is the specially designated collection containing encrypted data keys. There is no default
collection (user must specify). The key vault collection is used for automatic and explicit encryption/decryption as
well as key management functions.

For key management functions that require creating, updating, or deleting key documents in the key vault collection, the
corresponding operations MUST be done with write concern majority.

For encryption/decryption and key management functions that require reading key documents from the key vault collection,
the corresponding operations MUST be done with read concern majority.

Some key management functions may require multiple commands to complete their operation. Key management functions
currently assume there is no concurrent access of the key vault collection being operated on. Concurrent access to a key
vault collection being operated on may result in unexpected or undefined behavior. Support for concurrent key management
may be considered for future work.

See [Support sessions in key management functions](#support-sessions-in-key-management-functions).

## Auto encrypt and decrypt

An encrypted MongoClient automatically encrypts values for filtering and decrypts results.

The driver MUST use libmongocrypt to initiate auto encryption and decryption. Create the BSON command meant to be sent
over the wire, then pass that through the libmongocrypt state machine and use the returned BSON command in its place.
The state machine is created with the libmongocrypt function `mongocrypt_ctx_new` and initialized with a
`mongocrypt_ctx_encrypt_init` or `mongocrypt_ctx_decrypt_init`. See the
[libmongocrypt API documentation](https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/blob/master/src/mongocrypt.h) for more
information.

An encrypted MongoClient configured with bypassAutoEncryption MUST NOT attempt automatic encryption for any command.

Otherwise, an encrypted MongoClient MUST attempt to auto encrypt all commands. Note, the underlying implementation may
determine no encryption is necessary, or bypass many checks if the command is deemed to not possibly contain any
encrypted data (e.g. ping). See the appendix section:
[libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List](#libmongocrypt-auto-encryption-allow-list).

An encrypted MongoClient MUST attempt to auto decrypt the results of all commands.

Drivers MUST raise an error when attempting to auto encrypt a command if the maxWireVersion is less than 8. The error
message MUST contain "Auto-encryption requires a minimum MongoDB version of 4.2".

Note, all client side features (including all of `ClientEncryption`) are only supported against 4.2 or higher servers.
However, errors are only raised for automatic encryption/decryption against older servers. See
[Why is a 4.2 server required?](#why-is-a-42-server-required)

## Interaction with Command Monitoring

Unencrypted data MUST NOT appear in the data of any command monitoring events. Encryption MUST occur before generating a
CommandStartedEvent, and decryption MUST occur after generating a CommandSucceededEvent.

## Size limits for Write Commands

Automatic encryption requires the driver to serialize write commands as a single BSON document before automatically
encrypting with libmongocrypt (analogous to constructing [OP_MSG payload type 0](../message/OP_MSG.md#sections), not a
document sequence). Automatic encryption returns a single (possibly modified) BSON document as the command to send.

Because automatic encryption increases the size of commands, the driver MUST split bulk writes at a reduced size limit
before undergoing automatic encryption. The write payload MUST be split at 2MiB (2097152). Where batch splitting occurs
relative to automatic encryption is implementation-dependent.

Drivers MUST not reduce the size limits for a single write before automatic encryption. I.e. if a single document has
size larger than 2MiB (but less than `maxBsonObjectSize`) proceed with automatic encryption.

Drivers MUST document the performance limitation of enabling client side encryption by including the following
documentation in MongoClient:

> Enabling Client Side Encryption reduces the maximum write batch size and may have a negative performance impact.

### Key vault collection schema for data keys

Data keys are stored in the MongoDB key vault collection with the following schema:

| keyId     | String   | Required. keyId is the Unique Identifier to a 96 byte KMIP Secret Data managed object. |

Data keys are needed for encryption and decryption. They are identified in the intent-to-encrypt marking and ciphertext.
Data keys may be retrieved by querying the "\_id" with a UUID or by querying the "keyAltName" with a string.

Note, "status" is unused and is purely informational.

#### Example data key document

```
{
   "_id" : UUID("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"),
   "status" : 1,
   "masterKey" : {
      "provider" : "aws",
      "key" : "arn:aws...",
      "region" : "us-east-1"
   },
   "updateDate" : ISODate("2019-03-18T22:53:50.483Z"),
   "keyMaterial" : BinData(0,"AQICAH..."),
   "creationDate" : ISODate("2019-03-18T22:53:50.483Z"),
   "keyAltNames" : [
      "altname",
      "another_altname"
   ]
}
```

### BSON binary subtype 6

BSON Binary Subtype 6 has a one byte leading identifier. The following is a quick reference.

```typescript
struct {
   uint8 subtype;
   [more data - see individual type definitions]
}
```

#### Type 0: Intent-to-encrypt marking

```typescript
struct {
   uint8 subtype = 0;
   [ bson ];
}
```

#### Types 1 and 2: Ciphertext

```typescript
struct {
   uint8 subtype = (1 or 2);
   uint8 key_uuid[16];
   uint8 original_bson_type;
   uint32 ciphertext_length;
   uint8 ciphertext[ciphertext_length];
}
```

See [Driver Spec: BSON Binary Encrypted](../bson-binary-encrypted/binary-encrypted.md) for more information.

### JSONSchema "encrypt"

The additional support for encryption in JSONSchema will be documented in the MongoDB manual. But the following is an
example:

```typescript
encrypt : {
   bsonType: "int"
   algorithm: "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"
   keyId: [UUID(...)]
}
```

Each field is briefly described as follows:

| Name      | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bsonType  | string                  | The bsonType of the underlying encrypted field.                                                                                             |
| algorithm | string                  | "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Random" or <br>"AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_512-Deterministic"                                                 |
| keyId     | string or array of UUID | If string, it is a JSON pointer to a field with a scalar value <br>identifying a key by keyAltName.<br>If array, an array of eligible keys. |

### libmongocrypt: Prohibitions and warnings

libmongocrypt MUST validate options. The following noteworthy cases are prohibited:

- Explicit encryption using the deterministic algorithm on any of the following types:
  - array
  - document
  - code with scope
  - single value types: undefined, MinKey, MaxKey, Null
  - decimal128
  - double
  - bool
- Explicit encryption on a BSON binary subtype 6.

The following cases MUST warn:

- A local schema that does not include encrypted fields.

### libmongocrypt: Collection info caching

libmongocrypt will cache the collection infos so encryption with remote schemas need not run listCollections every time.
Collection infos (or lack thereof) are cached for one minute. This is not configurable. After expiration, subsequent
attempts to encrypt will result in libmongocrypt requesting a new collection info.

A collection info result indicates if the collection is really a view. If it is, libmongocrypt returns an error since it
does not know the schema of the underlying collection.

A collection info with validators that aside from one top level `$jsonSchema` are considered an error.

### libmongocrypt: Data key caching

Data keys are cached in libmongocrypt for one minute. This is not configurable, and there is no maximum number of keys
in the cache. The data key material is stored securely. It will not be paged to disk and the memory will be properly
zero'ed out after freeing.

### libmongocrypt: Crypto implementation

libmongocrypt uses AEAD_SHA256_CBC_HMAC512 for both "randomized" and "deterministic" encryption algorithms. It is
described in this [IETF document draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2-05). For
"randomized", libmongocrypt securely creates a random IV. For "deterministic", libmongocrypt securely creates a random
IV key and any given encryption operation will derive the IV from the IV key and the field plaintext data.

### libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List

libmongocrypt determines whether or not the command requires encryption (i.e. is sent to mongocryptd) based on the table
below. Commands not listed in this table will result in an error returned by libmongocrypt.

All AUTOENCRYPT commands are sent to mongocryptd, even if there is no JSONSchema. This is to ensure that commands that
reference other collections (e.g. aggregate with `$lookup`) are handled properly.

## Test Plan

See the [README.md](tests/README.md) in the test directory.

## Rationale

### Design Principles

In addition to the [Driver Mantras](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications#driver-mantras) there are design
principles specific to this project.

### 1. Make encryption easy to enable

Users should be able to enable encryption with minimal application change.

### 2. Minimize risk of exposing sensitive data

Storing or querying with unencrypted data can have dire consequences, because users may not be made aware immediately.
When in doubt, we should error. It should be clear to the user when an operation gets encrypted and when one doesn't.

### 3. Minimize API

The first version of Client Side Encryption is to get signal. If it becomes popular, further improvements will be made
(removing mongocryptd process, support for more queries, better performance). But the public API we provide now will
stick around for the long-term. So let's keep it minimal to accomplish our goals.

### How did we arrive at this API?

The API for client side encryption underwent multiple iterations during the design process.

#### Why is client side encryption configured on a MongoClient?

There is state that must be shared among all auto encrypted collections: the MongoClient to mongocryptd and the handle
to libmongocrypt (because key caching + JSONSchema caching occurs in libmongocrypt).

#### Why not make auto encryption "opt-in"?

Because auto encryption is specified with a collection JSONSchema, we cannot auto encrypt database or client operations.
So we cannot know if the user is passing sensitive data as a filter to a database/client change stream or a currentOp
command for example. We also must always fail on view operations. We considered making auto encryption opt-in for
collections. But we decided against this. It is much simpler for users to enable auto encryption without enumerating all
collections with encryption in the common case of using remote JSONSchemas.

Note, this takes the trade-off of a better user experience over less safety. If a user mistakenly assumes that auto
encryption occurs on a database, or on a collection doing a `$(graph)lookup` on a collection with auto encryption, they
may end up sending unencrypted data.

#### Why are auto encrypted collections configured at level of MongoClient?

In a previous iteration of the design, we proposed enabling auto encryption only in db.getCollection() for better
usability. But this better aligns with our design principles.

- Safer. Users won't forget to enable auto encryption on one call to db.getCollection()
- Easier. It only requires changing MongoClient code instead of every db.getCollection()

#### Why do we have a separate top level type for ClientEncryption?

The encrypt/decrypt and createDataKey functions were originally placed on MongoClient. But, then we'd have API that
depends on optional configuration. A new top level type seemed warranted.

#### Why not pass the ClientEncryption into db.getCollection() to enable auto encryption?

As it is now, a ClientEncryption and a MongoClient cannot share state (libmongocrypt handle or MongoClient to
mongocryptd). Foreseeably, they could share state if auto encryption was enabled by passing a ClientEncryption object
like:

```javascript
db.getCollection("coll", { autoEncrypt: { clientEncryption: clientEncryption } })
```

But this would require a MongoCollection to peek into the internals of a ClientEncryption object. This is messy and
language dependent to implement and makes mocking out the ClientEncryption difficult for tests.

#### Why do we need to pass a client to create a ClientEncryption?

We need to support an external key vault collection (i.e. on another MongoDB cluster).

#### Why are extraOptions and kmsProviders maps?

Because we don't want AWS as part of the public types and we don't want to put [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) and
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) options as types since mongocryptd is an implementation detail we'd like to hide as much
as possible.

#### Why is there a bypassAutoEncryption?

bypassAutoEncryption still supports auto decryption. In cases where [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) or
[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) cannot analyze a query, it's still useful to provide auto decryption. Just like static
program analysis cannot always prove that a runtime invariant holds,
[mongocryptd](#mongocryptd)/[crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) cannot always prove that a query will be safe with respect to
encryption at runtime.

### Why not require compatibility between mongocryptd and the server?

It isn't necessary or unsafe if mongocryptd parses an old version of MQL. Consider what happens when we add a new
operator, `$newOperator`. If it properly encrypts a value in the `$newOperator` expression and sends it to an old server
that doesn't have `$newOperator`, that's a mistake but not a security hole. Also if the app passes a query with
`$newOperator` to mongocryptd, and mongocryptd doesn't know about `$newOperator`, then it will error,
`"Unrecognized operator $newOperator"` or something. Also a mistake, not a security hole.

So long as mongocryptd errors on unrecognized expressions, we don't need version compatibility between the mongocryptd
and server for the sake of security.

### Why cache keys?

We can't re-fetch the key on each operation, the performance goal for this project requires us to cache. We do need a
revocation mechanism, based upon periodic checking from the client. Initially this window will not be configurable.

### Why require including a C library?

- libmongocrypt deduplicates a lot of the work: JSONSchema cache, KMS message construction/parsing, key caching, and
  encryption/decryption.
- Our "best-effort" of storing decrypted key material securely is best accomplished with a C library.
- Having crypto done in one centralized C library makes it much easier to audit the crypto code.

### Why warn if a local schema does not have encrypted fields?

Because that is the only use of local schemas. No other JSONSchema validators have any function. It's likely the user
misconfigured encryption.

### Why limit to one top-level `$jsonSchema`?

- If we allow siblings, we can run into cases where the user specifies a top-level `$and/$or` or any arbitrary
  match-expression that could have nested `$jsonSchema`'s.
- Furthermore, the initial versions of [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) and [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) are only
  implementing query analysis when the validator consists of a single `$jsonSchema` predicate. This helps to simplify
  the [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) and [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) logic, and unifies it with the case where users
  configure their schemas directly in the driver.

### Why not allow schemas to be configured at runtime?

We could have something like Collection::setEncryptionSchema(), but users can simply recreate the client to set new
local schemas.

### Why not support other AWS auth mechanisms?

We could potentially authenticate against AWS in a more sophisticated way, like read credentials from ~/.aws/credentials
or assuming a role with EC2 instance metadata. But we've decided to implement the simplest authentication mechanism for
v1, and defer more sophisticated ones as future work.

### Why not pass a URI for external key vault collections instead of a MongoClient?

Some configuration on a MongoClient can only be done programmatically. E.g. in Java TLS configuration can only be done
at runtime since it is abstracted in an SSLContext which cannot be accessed or altered by the driver.

### What happened to multiple key vault collections?

An earlier revision of this specification supported multiple active key vaults with the notion of a "key vault
collection alias". The key vault collection alias identified one of possibly many key vault collections that stored the
key to decrypt the ciphertext. However, enforcing one key vault collection is a reasonable restriction for users. There
isn't clear value in having multiple key vault collections. And having active multiple key vault collections is not
necessary to migrate key vault collections.

### Why auto encrypt a command instead of a wire protocol message?

- It is significantly easier to implement communication in drivers if libmongocrypt gives back BSON object that can be
  passed to run command.
- mongocryptd cannot return document sequences, so it will return an array of documents anyway.
- Though it is foreseeable that a driver can take the final result of encryption and turn it into an OP_MSG document
  sequence, it does not seem worthwhile to impose extra complexity in this case.

### Why is a failure to decrypt always an error?

In the original design we proposed *not* to error if decryption failed due to a missing key. But, it's not clear this is
a needed functionality, it goes against our principle of "Minimize API", and there's a simple recourse for users: bypass
mongocryptd and explicitly decrypt instead.

### Why are there no APM events for mongocryptd?

Though it may be helpful for debugging to expose APM events for mongocryptd, mongocryptd is an implementation detail
we'd like to have the freedom to remove in the future. So we want to expose mongocryptd as little as possible.

### Why aren't we creating a unique index in the key vault collection?

There should be a unique index on the `keyAltNames` field with a partial index filter for only documents where
`keyAltNames` exists. Although GridFS automatically creates indexes as a convenience upon first write, it has been
problematic before due to requiring the `createIndex` privilege, which a user might not have if they are just querying
the key vault collection with find and adding keys with insert.

See also <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/privilege-actions/#mongodb-authaction-createIndex>.

### Why do operations on views fail?

Currently, the driver does not resolve the entire view pipeline, which would be necessary to know the schema of the
underlying collection. But, the driver does know whether or not a namespace is a view based on the response to
listCollections. And the driver will run listCollections on all namespaces omitted from the schemaMap.

### Why is a 4.2 server required?

Limiting to 4.2 reduces testing complexity. Additionally The `encrypt` subdocument in JSON schema is only supported on
4.2 or higher servers. Although not technically necessary for client side encryption, it does provide a fallback against
accidentally sending unencrypted data from misconfigured clients.

### Why are serverSelectionTryOnce and cooldownMS disabled for single-threaded drivers connecting to mongocryptd?

By default, single threaded clients set serverSelectionTryOnce to true, which means server selection fails if a topology
scan fails the first time (i.e. it will not make repeat attempts until serverSelectionTimeoutMS expires). This behavior
is overridden since there may be a small delay between spawning mongocryptd (which the driver may be responsible for)
and for mongocryptd to listen on sockets. See the Server Selection spec description of
[serverSelectionTryOnce](../server-selection/server-selection.md#serverselectiontryonce).

Similarly, single threaded clients will by default wait for 5 second cooldown period after failing to connect to a
server before making another attempt. Meaning if the first attempt to mongocryptd fails to connect, then the user would
observe a 5 second delay. This is not configurable in the URI, so this must be overridden internally. Since mongocryptd
is a local process, there should only be a very short delay after spawning mongocryptd for it to start listening on
sockets. See the SDAM spec description of
[cooldownMS](../server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-monitoring.md#cooldownms).

Because single threaded drivers may exceed `serverSelectionTimeoutMS` by the duration of the topology scan,
`connectTimeoutMS` is also reduced.

### What's the deal with metadataClient, keyVaultClient, and the internal client?

When automatically encrypting a command, the driver runs:

- a `listCollections` command to determine if the target collection has a remote schema. This uses the `metadataClient`.
- a `find` against the key vault collection to fetch keys. This uses the `keyVaultClient`.

#### Why not reuse the parent MongoClient when maxPoolSize is limited?

These operations MUST NOT reuse the same connection pool as the parent `MongoClient` configured with automatic
encryption to avoid possible deadlock situations.

Drivers supporting a connection pool (see
[CMAP specification](../connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.md)) support an option for
limiting the connection pool size: `maxPoolSize`.

Drivers need to check out a connection before serializing the command. If the `listCollections` or `find` command during
automatic encryption uses the same connection pool as the parent MongoClient, the application is susceptible to
deadlocks.

Using the same connection pool causes automatic encryption to check out multiple connections from the pool when
processing a single command. If maxPoolSize=1, this is an immediate deadlock. If maxPoolSize=2, and two threads check
out the first connection, they will deadlock attempting to check out the second.

#### Why is keyVaultClient an exposed option, but metadataClient private?

The `keyVaultClient` supports the use case where the key vault collection is stored on a MongoDB cluster separate from
the data-bearing cluster.

The `metadataClient` is only used for `listCollections` against the data-bearing cluster.

`listCollections` responses are cached by libmongocrypt for one minute.

The use pattern of the `metadataClient` will likely greatly differ from the parent `MongoClient`. So it is configured
with `minPoolSize=0`.

The `metadataClient` is not an exposed option because a user could misconfigure it to point to another MongoDB cluster,
which could be a security risk.

#### Why is the metadataClient not needed if bypassAutoEncryption=true

JSON schema data is only needed for automatic encryption but not for automatic decryption. `listCollections` is not run
when `bypassAutoEncryption` is `true`, making a metadataClient unnecessary.

### Why are commands sent to mongocryptd on collections without encrypted fields?

If a `MongoClient` is configured with automatic encryption, all commands on collections listed as `AUTOENCRYPT` in
[libmongocrypt: Auto Encryption Allow-List](#libmongocrypt-auto-encryption-allow-list) undergo the automatic encryption
process. Even if the collection does not have an associated schema, the command is sent to mongocryptd as a safeguard. A
collection may not have encrypted fields, but a command on the collection may could have sensitive data as part of the
command arguments. For example:

```javascript
db.publicData.aggregate([
   {$lookup: {from: "privateData", localField: "_id", foreignField: "_id", as: "privateData"}},
   {$match: {"privateData.ssn": "123-45-6789"}},
])
```

The `publicData` collection does not have encrypted fields, but the `privateData` collection does. mongocryptd rejects
an aggregate with `$lookup` since there is no mechanism to determine encrypted fields of joined collections.

### Why do KMS providers require TLS options?

Drivers authenticate to KMIP servers with the client certificate presented in TLS connections.

This specification assumes that TLS connections to KMIP servers may require different TLS options than TLS connections
to MongoDB servers.

KMIP support in the MongoDB server is a precedent. The server supports `--kmipServerCAFile` and
`--kmipClientCertificateFile` to configure the encrypted storage engine KMIP. See
<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/configure-encryption/>.

TLS options may be useful for the AWS, Azure, and GCP KMS providers in a case where the default trust store does not
include the needed CA certificates.

### Why is it an error to have an FLE 1 and Queryable Encryption field in the same collection?

There is no technical limitation to having a separate FLE field and Queryable Encryption field in the same collection.
Prohibiting FLE and Queryable Encryption in the same collection reduces complexity. From the product perspective, a
random FLE field and a non-queryable Queryable Encryption field have the same behavior and similar security guarantees.
A deterministic FLE field leaks more information then a deterministic Queryable Encryption field. There is not a
compelling use case to use both FLE and Queryable Encryption in the same collection.

### Is it an error to set schemaMap and encryptedFieldsMap?

No. FLE and Queryable Encryption fields can coexist in different collections. The same collection cannot be in the
`encryptedFieldsMap` and `schemaMap`. [libmongocrypt](#libmongocrypt) will error if the same collection is specified in
a `schemaMap` and `encryptedFieldsMap`.

### Why is bypassQueryAnalysis needed?

Commands containing payloads for encrypted indexed fields require a top-level "encryptionInformation" field for the
server processing. `bypassQueryAnalysis` enables the use case of Explicit Encryption without the MongoDB Enterprise
Advanced licensed [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library or mongocryptd process.

Here is an example:

```go
// No MongoDB Enterprise Advanced licensed 'crypt_shared' shared library.
aeo := options.AutoEncryption().
   SetKeyVaultNamespace("keyvault.datakeys").
   SetEncryptedFieldsMap(efcMap).
   SetKmsProviders(kmsProviders).
   SetBypassQueryAnalysis(true)

co := options.Client().
   ApplyURI(uri).
   SetAutoEncryptionOptions(aeo)

encryptedClient, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, co)
defer encryptedClient.Disconnect(ctx)
if err != nil {
   log.Fatalf("error in Connect: %v", err)
}

coll := encryptedClient.Database("foo").Collection("bar")
// Explicit Encrypt an Queryable Encryption Indexed Field.
eo := options.Encrypt().
   SetEncryptIndexType(options.EncryptIndexEquality)
ciphertext, err := ce.Encrypt(ctx, val, eo)
// In InsertOne, libmongocrypt appends "encryptionInformation" to the insert command.
_, err = coll.InsertOne(ctx, bson.D{{"encryptedIndexed", ciphertext}})
if err != nil {
   log.Fatalf("error in InsertOne: %v", err)
}
```

A rejected alternative to adding `bypassQueryAnalysis` is to change the behavior of `bypassAutoEncryption`.
`bypassQueryAnalysis` is distinct from `bypassAutoEncryption`. `bypassAutoEncryption` bypasses all of libmongocrypt for
commands. Changing the behavior of `bypassAutoEncryption` could harm performance (e.g. by serializing as smaller
documents).

### Why does rewrapManyDataKey return RewrapManyDataKeyResult instead of BulkWriteResult?

`rewrapManyDataKey` is risky as it performs both a find and an update on the key vault collection. Using
`RewrapManyDataKeyResult` allows new fields to be added in the future and more easily deprecate the wrapped
`BulkWriteResult` if necessary.

### Why does ClientEncryption have key management functions when Drivers can use existing CRUD operations instead?

The key management functions are added for parity with mongosh to reduce friction between conducting operations using
mongosh and a Driver. Their inclusion assumes their value for users outweighs their cost of implementation and
maintenance.

### Why are the QueryType and Algorithm options a String?

Using an enum to represent QueryType was considered and rejected in
[DRIVERS-2352](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2352).

A string value helps with future compatibility. When new values of QueryType and IndexType are added in libmongocrypt,
users would only need to upgrade libmongocrypt, and not the driver, to use the new values.

### Why is there an encryptExpression helper?

Querying a range index requires encrypting a lower bound (value for `$gt` or `$gte`) and upper bound (value for `$lt` or
`$lte`) payload. A rejected alternative API is to encrypt the lower and upper bound payloads separately. The lower and
upper bound payloads must have a unique matching UUID. The lower and upper bound payloads are unique. This API requires
handling the UUID and distinguishing the upper and lower bounds. Here are examples showing possible errors:

```javascript
uuid = UUID()
lOpts = EncryptOpts(
   keyId=keyId, algorithm="range", queryType="range", uuid=uuid, bound="lower")
lower = clientEncryption.encrypt (value=30, lOpts)
uOpts = EncryptOpts(
   keyId=keyId, algorithm="range", queryType="range", uuid=uuid, bound="upper")
upper = clientEncryption.encrypt (value=40, uOpts)

# Both bounds match UUID ... OK
db.coll.find_one ({"age": {"$gt": lower, "$lt": upper }})

# Upper bound is used as a lower bound ... ERROR!
db.coll.find_one ({"age": {"$gt": upper }})

lower2 = clientEncryption.encrypt (value=35, lOpts)

# UUID is re-used ... ERROR!
db.coll.find_one ({ "$or": [
   {"age": {"$gt": lower, "$lt": upper }},
   {"age": {"$gt": lower2 }}
]})

# UUID does not match between lower and upper bound ... ERROR!
db.coll.find_one ({ "age": {"$gt": lower2, "$lt": upper }})
```

Requiring an Aggregate Expression or Match Expression hides the UUID and handles both bounds.

Returning an Aggregate Expression or Match Expression as a BSON document motivated adding a new
`ClientEncryption.encryptExpression()` helper. `ClientEncryption.encrypt()` cannot be reused since it returns a Binary.

To limit scope, only `$and` is supported. Support for other operators `($eq, $in)` can be added in the future if
desired.

### Why do on-demand KMS credentials not support named KMS providers?

libmongocrypt supports supplying KMS providers credentials on-demand. This enables obtaining credentials from the host
machine. Supporting on-demand credentials was added as part of these projects:
[DRIVERS-2280](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2280) ("aws"),
[DRIVERS-2377](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2377) ("gcp"),
[DRIVERS-2411](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2411) ("azure").

On-demand credentials are primarily intended to support passing credentials assigned in an environment. Supporting
on-demand credentials for more than one KMS provider of the same type is not expected to be useful. Supporting on-demand
KMS credentials would require added work in drivers inspecting the KMS providers when obtaining credentials, as well as
additional test coverage. Supporting on-demand KMS credentials for named KMS providers can be considered as future work
if needed.

### What is the KMIP `delegated` option?

By default, the KMS will retrieve the key encryption key from the KMIP server and use it to encrypt the data key. If the
`delegated` option is set to true (recommended), the KMIP server will instead perform encryption and decryption locally,
ensuring that the key encryption key never leaves the server.

## Future work

### Make libmonogocrypt cache window configurable

There's a principle at MongoDB, "no knobs", that we should honor wherever possible. Configurability is bad, mandating
one well-chosen value is good. But if our default caching behavior is discovered unsuitable for some use cases we may
add configuration as part of future work.

### APM events for encryption or key service interaction

APM events include the encrypted data before it is sent to the server, or before it is decrypted in a reply. Therefore,
app developers can determine whether or not encryption occurred by inspecting the values in their command monitoring
events. However, it might be useful to offer separate "encryption" and "decryption" events, as well as interactions with
the key service.

### Remove mongocryptd

A future version plans to remove the [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd) process and fold the logic into `libmongocrypt` using
the [crypt_shared](#crypt_shared) library. Therefore, this spec mandates that drivers use `libmongocrypt` to abstract
encryption logic, deduplicate work, and to provide a simpler future path to removing [mongocryptd](#mongocryptd).

### Support external key vault collection discovery

The only way to configure an external key vault collection is by passing a MongoClient.

For apps like Compass, where it may not be possible for users to configure this app side, there should ideally be enough
information in the database to decrypt data. (Excluding KMS credentials, which are still passed as MongoClient options).

We may want to store a URI to the external key vault collection somewhere in the data bearing cluster, so clients can
connect to the external key vault collection without additional user supplied configuration.

### Batch listCollections requests on expired schema cache entries

Currently libmongocrypt will refresh schemas one at a time.

### Add a maximum size for the JSONSchema/key cache.

They're unbounded currently.

### Recalculate message size bounds dynamically

Instead of using one reduced maxMessageSizeBytes, libmongocrypt could hide the complexity of properly resplitting bulk
writes after encryption. It could use a simple back-off algorithm: try marking a command with maxMessageSizeBytes=24MB.
If after marking we determine that's too large, try again with maxMessageSizeBytes=12MB and so on. And in the end
libmongocrypt would create multiple OP_MSGs to send.

### Support sessions in key management functions

Key management functions currently assume there are no concurrent accesses of the key vault collection being operated
on. To support concurrent access of the key vault collection, the key management functions may be overloaded to take an
explicit session parameter as described in the [Drivers Sessions Specification](../sessions/driver-sessions.md).

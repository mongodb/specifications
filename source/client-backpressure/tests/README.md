# Client Backpressure Tests

______________________________________________________________________

## Introduction

The YAML and JSON files in this directory are platform-independent tests meant to exercise a driver's implementation of
retryable reads. These tests utilize the [Unified Test Format](../../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.md).

Several prose tests, which are not easily expressed in YAML, are also presented in this file. Those tests will need to
be manually implemented by each driver.

# Index Management

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 3.6

______________________________________________________________________

## Specification

The index management spec defines a set of behaviour in the drivers for creating, removing and viewing indexes in a
collection. It defines implementation details when required but also provides flexibility in the driver in that one or
both of 2 unique APIs can be chosen to be implemented.

### Definitions

#### META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

#### Terms

**Collection**

The term `Collection` references the object in the driver that represents a collection on the server.

**Cursor**

The term `Cursor` references the driver's cursor object.

**Iterable**

The term `Iterable` is to describe an object that is a sequence of elements that can be iterated over.

**Document**

The term `Document` refers to the implementation in the driver's language of a BSON document.

**Result**

The term `Result` references the object that is normally returned by the driver as the result of a command execution. In
the case of situations where an actual command is not executed, rather an insert or a query, an object that adheres to
the same interface must be returned with as much information as possible that could be obtained from the operation.

### Guidance

#### Documentation

The documentation provided in code below is merely for driver authors and SHOULD NOT be taken as required documentation
for the driver.

#### Operations

All drivers MUST offer at least one of the sections of operations, the Standard API or the Index View API. The driver
MAY elect to have both. Implementation details are noted in the comments when a specific implementation is required.
Within each API, all methods are REQUIRED unless noted otherwise in the comments.

#### Operation Parameters

All drivers MUST include the specified parameters in each operation. This does not preclude a driver from offering more.
A driver SHOULD NOT require a user to specify the options parameter if they wish to use the server defaults.

As of 3.4 (see <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-769>) the server validates options passed to the `createIndexes`
command -- drivers should be aware when testing that passing arbitrary options when the driver does not validate them
could fail on the server.

#### Deviations

A non-exhaustive list of acceptable deviations are as follows:

- Using named parameters in place of an options hash or class. For instance,
  `collection.create_index({x: 1}, commit_quorum="majority")`.
- When using an `Options` class, if multiple `Options` classes are structurally equatable, it is permissible to
  consolidate them into one with a clear name. For instance, it would be permissible to use the name
  `CreateIndexOptions` as the options for `createIndex` and `createIndexes`.

#### Naming

All drivers MUST name operations and parameters as defined in the following sections. Exceptions to this rule are noted
in the appropriate section. Class and interface names may vary according to the driver and language best practices.

#### Naming Deviations

When deviating from a defined name, an author should consider if the altered name is recognizable and discoverable to
the user of another driver.

A non-exhaustive list of acceptable naming deviations are as follows:

- Using "maxTimeMS" as an example, .NET would use "MaxTime" where it's type is a TimeSpan structure that includes units.
  However, calling it "MaximumTime" would not be acceptable.
- Using "CreateIndexOptions" as an example, Javascript wouldn't need to name it while other drivers might prefer to call
  it "CreateIndexArgs" or "CreateIndexParams".
- Acceptable naming deviations should fall within the basic style of the language. For example, `createIndex` would be a
  required name in Java, where camel-case method names are used, but in Ruby `create_index` would be acceptable.

#### Index Name Generation

When the client generates a name for an index based on the keys, the driver MUST generate the name as key-direction
pairs, separated by underscores. For example, the key `{ name: 1, dob: -1 }` MUST generate an index name of
`name_1_dob_-1`.

Note there is one exception to this rule on the `_id` field. The server uses an index name with no direction, `_id_`,
which cannot be overridden.

#### Timeouts

Drivers MUST enforce timeouts for all operations per the
[Client Side Operations Timeout](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md) specification. All
operations that return cursors MUST support the timeout options documented in the
[Cursors](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md#cursors) section of that specification.

### Standard API

```typescript
interface Collection {

  /**
   * This is a convenience method for creating a single index. This MUST call the
   * createIndexes method and pass the provided specification document in a
   * sequence to that method with the same options.

   * @return The name of the created index.
   *
   * @note Drivers MAY opt to implement this method signature, the signature that
   *   takes an IndexModel as a parameter, or for those languages with method
   *   overloading MAY decide to implement both.
   *
   * @note Drivers MAY combine the two options types into a single one. If the options are
   *   explicitly typed, the combined options type MUST be named CreateIndexOptions or an acceptable
   *   variation.

}
```

### Enumerating Indexes

For all server versions, drivers MUST run a `listIndexes` command when enumerating indexes.

Drivers SHOULD use the method name `listIndexes` for a method that returns all indexes with a cursor return type.
Drivers MAY use an idiomatic variant that fits the language the driver is for. An exception is made for drivers
implementing the index view API.

In MongoDB 4.4, the `ns` field was removed from the index specifications returned from the `listIndexes` command.

- For drivers that report those index specifications in the form of documents or dictionaries, no special handling is
  necessary, but any documentation of the contents of the documents/dictionaries MUST indicate that the `ns` field will
  no longer be present in MongoDB 4.4+. If the contents of the documents/dictionaries are undocumented, then no special
  mention of the `ns` field is necessary.
- For drivers that report those index specifications in the form of statically defined models, the driver MUST manually
  populate the `ns` field of the models with the appropriate namespace if the server does not report it in the
  `listIndexes` command response. The `ns` field is not required to be a part of the models, however.

<span id="enumerate-indexes"></span>

#### Getting Index Names

Drivers MAY implement a method to enumerate all indexes, and return only the index names. The helper operates the same
as the following example:

Example:

```
> a = [];
[ ]
> db.runCommand( { listIndexes: 'poiConcat' } ).indexes.forEach(function(i) { a.push(i.name); } );
> a
[ "_id_", "ty_1", "l_2dsphere", "ts_1" ]
```

### Search Indexes

Server 7.0 introduced three new server commands and a new aggregation stage to facilitate management of search indexes.
Drivers MUST provide an API similar to the existing index management API specifically for search indexes. Drivers MAY
choose to implement either the standard API or the index view API.

#### Search Index Management Helper Options

There are currently no supported options for any of the search index management commands. To future proof drivers
implementations so that any options added in the future do not constitute a breaking change to drivers, empty options
structs have been added as placeholders. If a driver's language has a mechanism to add options in a non-breaking manner
(i.e., method overloading) drivers MAY omit the empty options structs from their search index management helpers.

`listSearchIndexes` is implemented using an aggregation pipeline. The list helper MUST support a driver's aggregation
options as outline in the [CRUD specification](../crud/crud.md#read). Drivers MAY combine the aggregation options with
any future `listSearchIndexes` stage options, if that is idiomatic for a driver's language.

#### Asynchronicity

The search index commands are asynchronous and return from the server before the index is successfully updated, created
or dropped. In order to determine when an index has been created / updated, users are expected to run the
`listSearchIndexes` repeatedly until index changes appear.

An example, from Javascript:

```typescript
const name = await collection.createSearchIndex({ definition: { ... fill out definition } })
while (!(await collection.listSearchIndexes({ name }).hasNext())) {
  await setTimeout(1000);
}
```

#### Where are read concern and write concern?

These commands internally proxy the search index management commands to a separate process that runs alongside an Atlas
cluster. As such, read concern and write concern are not relevant for the search index management commands.

Drivers MUST NOT apply a read concern or write concern to the commands. Atlas search index management commands return an
error if a `readConcern` or `writeConcern` field is present in the command.

#### Consistency with Existing APIs

Drivers SHOULD strive for a search index management API that is as consistent as possible with their existing index
management API.

#### NamespaceNotFound Errors

Some drivers suppress NamespaceNotFound errors for CRUD helpers. Drivers MAY suppress NamespaceNotFound errors from the
search index management helpers.

Drivers MUST suppress NamespaceNotFound errors for the `dropSearchIndex` helper. Drop operations should be idempotent:

```typescript
await collection.dropSearchIndex('my-test-index');
// subsequent calls should behave the same for the user as the first call
await collection.dropSearchIndex('my-test-index');
await collection.dropSearchIndex('my-test-index');
```

#### Common Interfaces

```typescript
interface SearchIndexModel {
  /**
   * Document describing the index to create.
   *
   * The definition syntax depends on whether you create a standard search index
   * or a vector search index.
   *
   * @see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/createSearchIndexes/
   */
  definition: Document;

  /**
   * Contains the options for the index.
   */
  options: SearchIndexOptions;
}

interface SearchIndexOptions {
  /**
   * Name of the search index to create.
   *
   * The server will use "default" if this option is not specified.
   */
  name: Optional<string>;

  /**
   * Type of search index to create. Defaults to "search" if not provided.
   *
   * Specify "search" for a standard search index or "vectorSearch" for a vector

### Q & A

Q: Where is write concern?

The `createIndexes` and `dropIndexes` commands take a write concern that indicates how the write is acknowledged. Since
all operations defined in this specification are performed on a collection, it's uncommon that two different index
operations on the same collection would use a different write concern. As such, the most natural place to indicate write
concern is on the client, the database, or the collection itself and not the operations within it.

However, it might be that a driver needs to expose write concern to a user per operation for various reasons. It is
permitted to allow a write concern option, but since writeConcern is a top-level command option, it MUST NOT be
specified as part of an `IndexModel` passed into the helper. It SHOULD be specified via the options parameter of the
helper. For example, it would be ambiguous to specify write concern for one or more models passed to `createIndexes()`,
but it would not be to specify it via the `CreateIndexesOptions`.

Q: What does the commitQuorum option do?

Prior to MongoDB 4.4, secondaries would simply replicate index builds once they were completed on the primary. Building
indexes requires an exclusive lock on the collection being indexed, so the secondaries would be blocked from replicating
all other operations while the index build took place. This would introduce replication lag correlated to however long
the index build took.

Starting in MongoDB 4.4, secondaries build indexes simultaneously with the primary, and after starting an index build,
the primary will wait for a certain number of data-bearing nodes, including itself, to have completed the build before
it commits the index. `commitQuorum` configures this node requirement. Once the index is committed, all the secondaries
replicate the commit too. If a secondary had already completed the index build, the commit will be quick, and no new
replication lag would be introduced. If a secondary had not finished building the index before the primary committed it
(e.g. if `commitQuorum: 0` was used), then that secondary may lag behind the primary while it finishes building and
committing the index.

The server-default value for `commitQuorum` is "votingMembers", which means the primary will wait for all voting
data-bearing nodes to complete building the index before it commits it.

Q: Why would a user want to specify a non-default `commitQuorum`

Like `w: "majority"`, `commitQuorum: "votingMembers"` doesn't consider non-voting data-bearing nodes such as analytics
nodes. If a user wanted to ensure these nodes didn't lag behind, then they would specify
`commitQuorum: <total number of data-bearing nodes, including non-voting nodes>`. Alternatively, if they wanted to
ensure only specific non-voting nodes didn't lag behind, they could specify a
[custom getLastErrorMode based on the nodes' tag sets](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/replica-configuration/#rsconf.settings.getLastErrorModes)
(e.g. `commitQuorum: <custom getLastErrorMode name>`).

Additionally, if a user has a high tolerance for replication lag, they can set a lower value for `commitQuorum`. This is
useful for situations where certain secondaries take longer to build indexes than the primaries, and the user doesn't
care if they lag behind.

Q: What is the difference between write concern and `commitQuorum`?

While these two options share a lot in terms of how they are specified, they configure entirely different things.
`commitQuorum` determines how much new replication lag an index build can tolerably introduce, but it says nothing of
durability. Write concern specifies the durability requirements of an index build, but it makes no guarantees about
introducing replication lag.

For instance, an index built with `writeConcern: { w: 1 }, commitQuorum: "votingMembers"` could possibly be rolled back,
but it will not introduce any new replication lag. Likewise, an index built with
`writeConcern: { w: "majority", j: true }, commitQuorum: 0` will not be rolled back, but it may cause the secondaries to
lag. To ensure the index is both durable and will not introduce replication lag on any data-bearing voting secondary,
`writeConcern: { w: "majority", j: true }, commitQuorum: "votingMembers"` must be used.

Also note that, since indexes are built simultaneously, higher values of `commitQuorum` are not as expensive as higher
values of `writeConcern`.

Q: Why does the driver manually throw errors if the `commitQuorum` option is specified against a pre 4.4 server?<br>
Starting in 3.4, the server validates all options passed to the `createIndexes` command, but due to a bug in versions
4.2.0-4.2.5 of the server (SERVER-47193), specifying `commitQuorum` does not result in an error. The option is used
internally by the server on those versions, and its value could have adverse effects on index builds. To prevent users
from mistakenly specifying this option, drivers manually verify it is only sent to 4.4+ servers.

# Wire Compression in Drivers

- Status: Accepted

- Minimum Server Version: 3.4

## Abstract

This specification describes how to implement Wire Protocol Compression between MongoDB drivers and mongo\[d|s\].

Compression is achieved through a new bi-directional wire protocol opcode, referred to as OP_COMPRESSED.

Server side compressor support is checked during the initial MongoDB Handshake, and is compatible with all historical
versions of MongoDB. If a client detects a compatible compressor it will use the compressor for all valid requests.

## META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Terms

*Compressor* - A compression algorithm. There are currently three supported algorithms: snappy, zlib, and zstd.

## Specification

### MongoDB Handshake Amendment

The [MongoDB Handshake Protocol](../mongodb-handshake/handshake.md) describes an argument passed to the handshake
command, `client`. This specification adds an additional argument, `compression`, that SHOULD be provided to the
handshake command if a driver supports wire compression.

The value of this argument is an array of supported compressors.

Example:

```javascript
    {
        hello: 1,
        client: {}, /* See MongoDB Handshake */
        compression: ["snappy", "zlib", "zstd"]
    }
```

When no compression is enabled on the client, drivers SHOULD send an empty compression argument.

Example:

```javascript
    {
        hello: 1,
        client: {}, /* See MongoDB Handshake */
        compression: []
    }
```

Clients that want to compress their messages need to send a list of the algorithms - in the order they are specified in
the client configuration - that they are willing to support to the server during the initial handshake call. For
example, a client wishing to compress with the snappy algorithm, should send:

```javascript
    { hello: 1, ... , compression: [ "snappy" ] }
```

The server will respond with the intersection of its list of supported compressors and the client's. For example, if the
server had both snappy and zlib enabled and the client requested snappy, it would respond with:

```javascript
    { ... , compression: [ "snappy" ], ok: 1 }
```

If the client included both snappy and zlib, the server would respond with something like:

```javascript
    { ... , compression: [ "snappy", "zlib" ], ok: 1 }
```

If the server has no compression algorithms in common with the client, it sends back a handshake response without a
compression field. Clients MAY issue a log level event to inform the user, but MUST NOT error.

When MongoDB server receives a compressor it can support it MAY reply to any and all requests using the selected
compressor, including the reply of the initial MongoDB Handshake. As each OP_COMPRESSED message contains the compressor
ID, clients MUST NOT assume which compressor each message uses, but MUST decompress the message using the compressor
identified in the OP_COMPRESSED opcode header.

When compressing, clients MUST use the first compressor in the client's configured compressors list that is also in the
servers list.

### Connection String Options

Two new connection string options:

#### compressors

Comma separated list of compressors the client should present to the server. Unknown compressors MUST yield a warning,
as per the Connection String specification, and MUST NOT be included in the handshake. By default, no compressor is
configured and thus compression will not be used. When multiple compressors are provided, the list should be treated as
a priority ordered list of compressors to use, with highest priority given to the first compressor in the list, and
lowest priority to the last compressor in the list.

Example:

```
    mongodb://localhost/?compressors=zstd,snappy,zlib
```

#### zlibCompressionLevel

Integer value from `-1` - `9`. This configuration option only applies to the zlib compressor. When zlib is not one of
the compressors enumerated by the `compressors` configuration option then providing this option has no meaning, but
clients SHOULD NOT issue a warning.

| Level | Description                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------- |
| -1    | Default Compression (usually 6) |
| 0     | No compression                  |
| 1     | Best Speed                      |
| 9     | Best Compression                |

Note that this value only applies to the client side compression level, not the response.

### OP_COMPRESSED

The new opcode, called OP_COMPRESSED, has the following structure:

```c
    struct OP_COMPRESSED {
        struct MsgHeader {
            int32  messageLength;
            int32  requestID;
            int32  responseTo;
            int32  opCode = 2012;
        };
        int32_t  originalOpcode;
        int32_t  uncompressedSize;
        uint8_t  compressorId;
        char    *compressedMessage;
    };
```

| Field             | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| originalOpcode    | Contains the value of the wrapped opcode.                                |
| uncompressedSize  | The size of the deflated compressedMessage, which excludes the MsgHeader |
| compressorId      | The ID of the compressor that compressed the message                     |
| compressedMessage | The opcode itself, excluding the MsgHeader                               |

### Compressor IDs

Each compressor is assigned a predefined compressor ID.

| compressorId | Handshake Value | Description                                                                                |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0            | noop            | The content of the message is uncompressed.<br>This is realistically only used for testing |
| 1            | snappy          | The content of the message is compressed using snappy.                                     |
| 2            | zlib            | The content of the message is compressed using zlib.                                       |
| 3            | zstd            | The content of the message is compressed using zstd.                                       |
| 4-255        | reserved        | Reserved for future use.                                                                   |

### Compressible messages

Any opcode can be compressed and wrapped in an `OP_COMPRESSED` header. The `OP_COMPRESSED` is strictly a wire protocol
without regards to what opcode it wraps, be it `OP_QUERY`, `OP_REPLY`, `OP_MSG` or any other future or past opcode. The
`compressedMessage` contains the original opcode, excluding the standard `MsgHeader`. The `originalOpcode` value
therefore effectively replaces the standard `MsgHeader` of the compressed opcode.

There is no guarantee that a response will be compressed even though compression was negotiated for in the handshake.
Clients MUST be able to parse both compressed and uncompressed responses to both compressed and uncompressed requests.

MongoDB 3.4 will always reply with a compressed response when compression has been negotiated, but future versions may
not.

A client MAY choose to implement compression for only `OP_QUERY`, `OP_REPLY`, and `OP_MSG`, and perhaps for future
opcodes, but not to implement it for `OP_INSERT`, `OP_UPDATE`, `OP_DELETE`, `OP_GETMORE`, and `OP_KILLCURSORS`.

Note that certain messages, such as authentication commands, MUST NOT be compressed. All other messages MUST be
compressed, when compression has been negotiated and the driver has implemented compression for the opcode in use.

### Messages not allowed to be compressed

In efforts to mitigate against current and previous attacks, certain messages MUST NOT be compressed, such as
authentication requests.

Messages using the following commands MUST NOT be compressed:

- hello
- legacy hello (see [MongoDB Handshake Protocol](../mongodb-handshake/handshake.md) for details)
- saslStart
- saslContinue
- getnonce
- authenticate
- createUser
- updateUser
- copydbSaslStart
- copydbgetnonce
- copydb

## Test Plan

There are no automated tests accompanying this specification, instead the following is a description of test scenarios
clients should implement.

In general, after implementing this functionality and the test cases, running the traditional client test suite against
a server with compression enabled, and ensuring the test suite is configured to provide a valid compressor as part of
the connection string, is a good idea. MongoDB-supported drivers MUST add such variant to their CI environment.

The following cases assume a standalone MongoDB 3.4 (or later) node configured with:

```
    mongod --networkMessageCompressors "snappy" -vvv
```

Create an example application which connects to a provided connection string, runs `ping: 1`, and then quits the program
normally.

- Create example program that authenticates to the server using SCRAM-SHA-1, then creates another user (MONGODB-CR),
  then runs hello followed with serverStatus.

- Reconnect to the same server using the created MONGODB-CR credentials. Observe that the only command that was
  decompressed on the server was `serverStatus`, while the server replied with OP_COMPRESSED for at least the
  serverStatus command.

## Motivation For Change

Drivers provide the canonical interface to MongoDB. Most tools for MongoDB are written with the aid of MongoDB drivers.
There exist a lot of tools for MongoDB that import massive datasets which could stand to gain a lot from compression.
Even day-to-day applications stand to gain from reduced bandwidth utilization at low cpu costs, especially when doing
large reads off the network.

Not all use cases fit compression, but we will allow users to decide if wire compression is right for them.

## Design rationale

Snappy has minimal cost and provides a reasonable compression ratio, but it is not expected to be available for all
languages MongoDB Drivers support. Supporting zlib is therefore important to the ecosystem, but for languages that do
support snappy we expected it to be the default choice. While snappy has no knobs to tune, zlib does have support for
specifying the compression level (tuned from speed to compression). As we don’t anticipate adding support for
compression libraries with complex knobs to tune this specification has opted not to define a complex configuration
structure and only define the currently relevant `zlibCompressionLevel`. When other compression libraries are supported,
adding support for configuring that library (if any is needed) should be handled on a case by case basis.

More recently, the MongoDB server added Zstandard (zstd) support for another modern alternative to zlib.

## Backwards Compatibility

The new argument provided to the MongoDB Handshake has no backwards compatible implications as servers that do not
expect it will simply ignore it. This means a server will therefore never reply with a list of acceptable compressors
which in turns means a client CANNOT use the OP_COMPRESSED opcode.

## Reference Implementation

- [mongoc](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-2116)

## Future Work

Possible future improvements include defining an API to determine compressor and configuration per operation, rather
than needing to create two different client pools, one for compression and one without, when the user is expecting only
needing to (not) compress very few operations.

## Q & A

- Statistics?

  - See [serverStatus](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/) in the server

- How to try this/enable it?

  - `mongod --networkMessageCompressors "snappy"`

- The server MAY reply with compressed data even if the request was not compressed?

  - Yes, and this is in fact the behaviour of MongoDB 3.4

- Can drivers compress the initial MongoDB Handshake/hello request?

  - No.

- Can the server reply to the MongoDB Handshake/hello compressed?

  - Yes, yes it can. Be aware it is completely acceptable for the server to use compression for any and all replies,
    using any supported compressor, when the client announced support for compression - this includes the reply to the
    actual MongoDB Handshake/hello where the support was announced.

- This is billed a MongoDB 3.6 feature -- but I hear it works with MongoDB3.4?

  - Yes, it does. All MongoDB versions support the `compression` argument to the initial handshake and all MongoDB
    versions will reply with an intersection of compressors it supports. This works even with MongoDB 3.0, as it will
    not reply with any compressors. It also works with MongoDB 3.4 which will reply with `snappy` if it was part of the
    driver's list. MongoDB 3.6 will likely include zlib support.

- Which compressors are currently supported?

  - MongoDB 3.4 supports `snappy`
  - MongoDB 3.6 supports `snappy` and `zlib`
  - MongoDB 4.2 supports `snappy`, `zlib`, and `zstd`

- My language supports xyz compressor, should I announce them all in the handshake?

  - No. But you are allowed to if you really want to make sure you can use that compressor with MongoDB 42 and your
    current driver versions.

- My language does not support xzy compressor. What do I do?

  - That is OK. You don’t have to support xyz.

- No MongoDB supported compressors are available for my language

  - That is OK. You don’t have to support compressors you can’t support. All it means is you can’t compress the request,
    and since you never declared support for any compressor, you won’t be served with compressed responses either.

- Why did the server not support zlib in MongoDB 3.4?

  - Snappy was selected for its very low performance hit, while giving reasonable compression, resulting in quite
    significant bandwidth reduction. Zlib characteristics are slightly different out-of-the-box and did not make sense
    for the initial goal of reducing bandwidth between replica set nodes.

- If snappy is preferable to zlib, why add support for zlib in MongoDB 3.6?

  - Zlib is available on every platform known to man. Snappy is not. Having zlib support makes sense for client traffic,
    which could originate on any type of platform, which may or may not support snappy.

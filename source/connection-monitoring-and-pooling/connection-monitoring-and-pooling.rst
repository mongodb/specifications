Abstract
========

Drivers currently support a variety of options that allow users to configure connection pooling behavior. Users are confused by drivers supporting different subsets of these options. Additionally, drivers implement their connection pools differently, making it difficult to design cross-driver pool functionality. By unifying and codifying pooling options and behavior across all drivers, we will increase user comprehension and code base maintainability.

META 
====

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`_.

Definitions
===========

Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Connection (when linked) refers to the ``Connection`` type defined in the
`Connection Pool Members`_ section of this specification. It does not refer to an actual TCP
connection to an Endpoint. A ``Connection`` will attempt to create and wrap such
a TCP connection over the course of its existence, but it is not equivalent to
one nor does it wrap an active one at all times.

For the purposes of testing, a mocked ``Connection`` type could be used with the
pool that never actually creates a TCP connection or performs any I/O.

Endpoint
~~~~~~~~

For convenience, an Endpoint refers to either a **mongod** or **mongos** instance.

Thread
~~~~~~

For convenience, a Thread refers to:

-  A shared-address-space process (a.k.a. a thread) in multi-threaded drivers
-  An Execution Frame / Continuation in asynchronous drivers
-  A goroutine in Go

Behavioral Description
======================

Which Drivers this applies to
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This specification is solely concerned with drivers that implement a connection pool. A driver SHOULD implement a connection pool, but is not required to.

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All drivers that implement a connection pool MUST implement and conform to the same MongoClient options. There can be slight deviation in naming to make the options idiomatic to the driver language.

Connection Pool Behaviors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All driver connection pools MUST provide an API that allows the driver to check out a connection, check in a connection back to the pool, and clear all connections in the pool. This API is for internal use only, and SHOULD NOT be documented as a public API.

Connection Pool Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All drivers that implement a connection pool MUST provide an API that allows users to subscribe to events emitted from the pool.

Detailed Design
===============

.. _connection-pool-options-1:

Connection Pool Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Drivers that implement a Connection Pool MUST support the following ConnectionPoolOptions:

.. code:: typescript

    interface ConnectionPoolOptions {
      /**
       *  The maximum number of Connections that may be associated
       *  with a pool at a given time. This includes in use and
       *  available connections.
       *  If specified, MUST be an integer >= 0.
       *  A value of 0 means there is no limit.
       *  Defaults to 100.
       */
      maxPoolSize?: number;

      /**
       *  The minimum number of Connections that MUST exist at any moment
       *  in a single connection pool.
       *  If specified, MUST be an integer >= 0. If maxPoolSize is > 0
       *  then minPoolSize must be <= maxPoolSize
       *  Defaults to 0.
       */
      minPoolSize?: number;

      /**
       *  The maximum amount of time a Connection should remain idle
       *  in the connection pool before being marked idle.
       *  If specified, MUST be a number >= 0.
       *  A value of 0 means there is no limit.
       *  Defaults to 0.
       */
      maxIdleTimeMS?: number;
    }

Additionally, Drivers that implement a Connection Pool MUST support the following ConnectionPoolOptions UNLESS that driver meets ALL of the following conditions:

-  The driver/language currently has an idiomatic timeout mechanism implemented
-  The timeout mechanism conforms to `the aggressive requirement of timing out a thread in the WaitQueue <#w1dcrm950sbn>`__

.. code:: typescript

    interface ConnectionPoolOptions {
      /**
       *  The maximum amount of time a thread can wait for a connection
       *  to become available.
       *  If specified, MUST be a number >= 0.
       *  A value of 0 means there is no limit.
       *  Defaults to 0.
       */
      waitQueueTimeoutMS?: number;
    }

These options MUST be specified at the MongoClient level, and SHOULD be named in a manner idiomatic to the driver's language. All connection pools created by a MongoClient MUST use the same ConnectionPoolOptions.

When parsing a mongodb connection string, a user MUST be able to specify these options using the default names specified above.

Deprecated Options
------------------

The following ConnectionPoolOptions are considered deprecated. They MUST NOT be implemented if they do not already exist in a driver, and they SHOULD be deprecated and removed from drivers that implement them as early as possible:

.. code:: typescript

    interface ConnectionPoolOptions {
      /**
       *  The maximum number of threads that can simultaneously wait
       *  for a Connection to become available.
       */
      waitQueueSize?: number;

      /**
       *  An alternative way of setting waitQueueSize, it specifies
       *  the maximum number of threads that can wait per connection.
       *  waitQueueSize === waitQueueMultiple \* maxPoolSize
       */
      waitQueueMultiple?: number
    }

Connection Pool Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Connection
----------

A driver-defined wrapper around a single TCP connection to an Endpoint. A `Connection`_ has the following properties:

-  **Single Endpoint:** A `Connection`_ MUST be associated with a single Endpoint. A `Connection`_ MUST NOT be associated with multiple Endpoints.
-  **Single Lifetime:** A `Connection`_ MUST NOT be used after it is closed.
-  **Single Owner:** A `Connection`_ MUST belong to exactly one Pool, and MUST NOT be shared across multiple pools
-  **Single Track:** A `Connection`_ MUST limit itself to one request / response at a time. A `Connection`_ MUST NOT multiplex/pipeline requests to an Endpoint.
-  **Monotonically Increasing ID:** A `Connection`_ MUST have an ID number associated with it. `Connection`_ IDs within a Pool MUST be assigned in order of creation, starting at 1 and increasing by 1 for each new Connection.
-  **Valid Connection:** A connection MUST NOT be checked out of the pool until it has successfully and fully completed a MongoDB Handshake and Authentication as specified in the `Handshake <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/mongodb-handshake/handshake.rst>`__, `OP_COMPRESSED <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/compression/OP_COMPRESSED.rst>`__, and `Authentication <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/auth/auth.rst>`__ specifications.
-  **Perishable**: it is possible for a `Connection`_ to become **Perished**. A `Connection`_ is considered perished if any of the following are true:

   -  **Stale:** The `Connection`_ 's generation does not match the generation of the parent pool
   -  **Idle:** The `Connection`_ is currently "available" (as defined below) and has been for longer than **maxIdleTimeMS**.
   -  **Errored:** The `Connection`_ has experienced an error that indicates it is no longer recommended for use. Examples include, but are not limited to:

      -  Network Error
      -  Network Timeout
      -  Endpoint closing the connection
      -  Driver-Side Timeout
      -  Wire-Protocol Error

.. code:: typescript

    interface Connection {
      /**
       *  An id number associated with the Connection
       */
      id: number;

      /**
       *  The address of the pool that owns this Connection
       */
      address: string;

      /**
       *  An integer representing the “generation” of the pool
       *  when this Connection was created
       */
      generation: number;

      /**
       * The current state of the Connection.
       *
       * Possible values are the following:
       *   - "pending":       The Connection has been created but has not yet been established. Contributes to
       *                      totalConnectionCount and pendingConnectionCount.
       *
       *   - "available":     The Connection has been established and is waiting in the pool to be checked
       *                      out. Contributes to both totalConnectionCount and availableConnectionCount.
       *
       *   - "in use":        The Connection has been established, checked out from the pool, and has yet
       *                      to be checked back in. Contributes to totalConnectionCount.
       *
       *   - "closed":        The Connection has had its socket closed and cannot be used for any future
       *                      operations. Does not contribute to any connection counts.
       *
       * Note: this field is mainly used for the purposes of describing state
       * in this specification. It is not required that drivers
       * actually include this field in their implementations of Connection.
       */
      state: "pending" | "available" | "in use" | "closed";
    }

WaitQueue
---------

A concept that represents pending requests for `Connections <#connection>`_. When a thread requests a `Connection <#connection>`_ from a Pool, the thread enters the Pool's WaitQueue. A thread stays in the WaitQueue until it either receives a `Connection <#connection>`_ or times out. A WaitQueue has the following traits:

-  **Thread-Safe**: When multiple threads attempt to enter or exit a WaitQueue, they do so in a thread-safe manner.
-  **Ordered/Fair**: When `Connections <#connection>`_ are made available, they are issued out to threads in the order that the threads entered the WaitQueue.
-  **Timeout aggressively:** If **waitQueueTimeoutMS** is set, members of a WaitQueue MUST timeout if they are enqueued for longer than waitQueueTimeoutMS. Members of a WaitQueue MUST timeout aggressively, and MUST leave the WaitQueue immediately upon timeout.

The implementation details of a WaitQueue are left to the driver.
Example implementations include:

-  A fair Semaphore
-  A Queue of callbacks

Connection Pool
---------------

A driver-defined entity that encapsulates all non-monitoring
`Connections <#connection>`_ associated with a single Endpoint. The pool
has the following properties:

-  **Thread Safe:** All Pool behaviors MUST be thread safe.
-  **Not Fork-Safe:** A Pool is explicitly not fork-safe. If a Pool detects that is it being used by a forked process, it MUST immediately clear itself and update its pid
-  **Single Owner:** A Pool MUST be associated with exactly one Endpoint, and MUST NOT be shared between Endpoints.
-  **Emit Events:** A Pool MUST emit pool events when dictated by this spec (see `Connection Pool Monitoring <#connection-pool-monitoring>`__). Users MUST be able to subscribe to emitted events in a manner idiomatic to their language and driver.
-  **Closeable:** A Pool MUST be able to be manually closed. When a Pool is closed, the following behaviors change:

   -  Checking in a `Connection <#connection>`_ to the Pool automatically closes the `Connection <#connection>`_
   -  Attempting to check out a `Connection <#connection>`_ from the Pool results in an Error

-  **Capped:** a pool is capped if **maxPoolSize** is set to a non-zero value. If a pool is capped, then its total number of `Connections <#connection>`_ (including available and in use) MUST NOT exceed **maxPoolSize**
-  **Rate-limited:** A Pool MUST limit the number of connections being created at a given time to be 2 (maxConnecting). 


.. code:: typescript

    interface ConnectionPool {
      /**
       *  The Queue of threads waiting for a Connection to be available
       */
      waitQueue: WaitQueue;
    
      /**
       *  A generation number representing the SDAM generation of the pool
       */
      generation: number;
    
      // Any of the following connection counts may be computed rather than
      // actually stored on the pool.

      /**
       *  An integer expressing how many total Connections
       *  ("pending" + "available" + "in use") the pool currently has
       */
      totalConnectionCount: number;
    
      /**
       *  An integer expressing how many Connections are currently
       *  available in the pool.
       */
      availableConnectionCount: number;

      /**
       *  An integer expressing how many Connections are currently
       *  being established.
       */
      pendingConnectionCount: number;

      /**
       *  Returns a Connection for use
       */
      checkOut(): Connection;

      /**
       *  Check in a Connection back to the Connection pool
       */
      checkIn(connection: Connection): void;

      /**
       *  Mark all current Connections as stale.
       */
      clear(): void;

      /**
       *  Closes the pool, preventing the pool from creating and returning new Connections
       */
      close(): void;
    }

.. _connection-pool-behaviors-1:

Connection Pool Behaviors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a Connection Pool
--------------------------

This specification does not define how a pool is to be created, leaving it
up to the driver. Creation of a connection pool is generally an implementation
detail of the driver, i.e., is not a part of the public API of the driver.
The SDAM specification defines `when
<https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.rst#connection-pool-creation>`_
the driver should create connection pools.

Once a pool is created, if minPoolSize is set, the pool MUST immediately begin
being `populated
<#populating-the-pool-with-a-connection-internal-implementation>`_ with enough
`Connections <#connection>`_ such that totalConnections >= minPoolSize. This
MUST be done in a non-blocking manner, such as via the use of a background
thread or asynchronous I/O. See `Populating the Pool with a Connection
<#populating-the-pool-with-a-connection-internal-implementation>`_ for more
details on the steps involved.

.. code::

    set generation to 0
    emit PoolCreatedEvent
    if minPoolSize is set:
      # this MAY be performed on a background thread
      # if it is not performed on a background thread, this MUST
      # utilize non-blocking I/O.
      while totalConnectionCount < minPoolSize:
        populate pool with a connection

Closing a Connection Pool
-------------------------

When a pool is closed, it MUST first close all available `Connections <#connection>`_ in that pool. This results in the following behavior changes:

-  In use `Connections <#connection>`_ MUST be closed when they are checked in to the closed pool.
-  Attempting to check out a `Connection <#connection>`_ MUST result in an error.

.. code::

    mark pool as CLOSED
    for connection in availableConnections:
      close connection
    emit PoolClosedEvent

Creating a Connection (Internal Implementation)
-----------------------------------------------

When creating a `Connection <#connection>`_, the initial `Connection <#connection>`_ is in a
“pending” state. This only creates a “virtual” `Connection <#connection>`_, and
performs no I/O. 

.. code::

    connection = new Connection()
    increment totalConnectionCount
    increment pendingConnectionCount
    set connection state to "pending"
    emit ConnectionCreatedEvent
    return connection

Establishing a Connection (Internal Implementation)
---------------------------------------------------

Before a `Connection <#connection>`_ can be marked as either "available" or "in use", it
must be established. This process involves performing the initial
handshake, handling OP_COMPRESSED, and performing authentication.

.. code::

    try:
      connect connection via TCP / TLS
      perform connection handshake
      handle OP_COMPRESSED
      perform connection authentication
      emit ConnectionReadyEvent
      return connection
    except error:
      close connection
      throw error # Propagate error in manner idiomatic to language.


Closing a Connection (Internal Implementation)
----------------------------------------------

When a `Connection <#connection>`_ is closed, it MUST first be marked as "closed",
removing it from being counted as "available" or "in use". Once that is
complete, the `Connection <#connection>`_ can perform whatever teardown is
necessary to close its underlying socket. The Driver SHOULD perform this
teardown in a non-blocking manner, such as via the use of a background
thread or async I/O.

.. code::

    original state = connection state
    set connection state to "closed"

    if original state is "available":
      decrement availableConnectionCount
    else if original state is "pending":
      decrement pendingConnectionCount

    decrement totalConnectionCount
    emit ConnectionClosedEvent

    # The following can happen at a later time (i.e. in background
    # thread) or via non-blocking I/O.
    connection.socket.close()

Marking a Connection as Available (Internal Implementation)
-----------------------------------------------------------

A `Connection <#connection>`_ is "available" if it is able to be checked out. A
`Connection <#connection>`_ MUST NOT be marked as "available" until it has been
established. The pool MUST keep track of the number of currently
available `Connections <#connection>`_.

.. code::

   increment availableConnectionCount
   set connection state to "available"
   add connection to availableConnections


Populating the Pool with a Connection (Internal Implementation)
---------------------------------------------------------------

"Populating" the pool involves preemptively creating and establishing a
`Connection <#connection>`_ which is marked as "available" for use in future
operations. This process is used to help ensure the number of established
connections managed by the pool is at least minPoolSize.

Populating the pool MUST NOT block any application threads. For example, it
could be performed on a background thread or via the use of non-blocking/async
I/O.

.. code::

   wait until pendingConnectionCount < maxConnecting
   create connection
   establish connection
   mark connection as available


Checking Out a Connection
-------------------------

A Pool MUST have a method that allows the driver to check out a `Connection`_.
Checking out a `Connection`_ involves submitting a request to the WaitQueue and,
once that request reaches the front of the queue, having the Pool find or create
a `Connection`_ to fulfill that request. If waitQueueTimeoutMS is specified,
then requests MUST time out after spending waitQueueTimeoutMS or longer in the
WaitQueue without receiving a `Connection`_.

To service a request for a `Connection`_, the Pool MUST first iterate over the
list of available `Connections <#connection>`_, searching for a non-perished one
to be returned. If a perished `Connection`_ is encountered, such a `Connection`_
MUST be closed (as described in `Closing a Connection
<#closing-a-connection-internal-implementation>`_) and the iteration of
available `Connections <#connection>`_ MUST continue until either a non-perished
available `Connection`_ is found or the list of available `Connections
<#connection>`_ is exhausted.

If the list is exhausted, the total number of `Connections <#connection>`_ is
less than maxPoolSize, and pendingConnectionCount < maxConnecting, the pool MUST
create a `Connection`_, establish it, mark it as "in use" and return it. If
totalConnectionCount == maxPoolSize or pendingConnectionCount == maxConnecting,
then the pool MUST wait to service the request until either both of those
conditions are met or until a `Connection`_ becomes available, re-entering the
checkOut loop in either case. This waiting MUST NOT prevent `Connections
<#connection>`_ from being checked into the pool. Additionally, the Pool MUST
NOT service any newer checkOut requests before fulfilling the original one which
could not be fulfilled. For drivers that implement the WaitQueue via a fair
semaphore, a condition variable may also be needed to to meet this
requirement. Waiting on the condition variable SHOULD also be limited by the
WaitQueueTimeout, if the driver supports one and it was specified by the user.

If the pool is closed, any attempt to check out a `Connection <#connection>`_ MUST throw an Error, and any items in the waitQueue MUST be removed from the waitQueue and throw an Error.

If minPoolSize is set, the `Connection <#connection>`_ Pool MUST always have at
least minPoolSize total `Connections <#connection>`_. If the pool does not
implement a background thread, the checkOut method is responsible for
`populating the pool
<#populating-the-pool-with-a-connection-internal-implementation>`_ with enough
`Connections <#connection>`_ such that this requirement is met.

A `Connection <#connection>`_ MUST NOT be checked out until it is
established. In addition, the Pool MUST NOT prevent other threads from checking
out `Connections <#connection>`_ while establishing a `Connection
<#connection>`_.

Before a given `Connection <#connection>`_ is returned from checkOut, it must be marked as
"in use", and the pool's availableConnectionCount MUST be decremented.

.. code::

    connection = Null
    emit ConnectionCheckOutStartedEvent
    try:
      enter WaitQueue
      wait until at top of wait queue
      # Note that in a lock-based implementation of the wait queue would
      # only allow one thread in the following block at a time
      while connection is Null:
        if a connection is available:
          while connection is Null and a connection is available:
            connection = next available connection
            if connection is perished:
              close connection
              connection = Null
        else if totalConnectionCount < maxPoolSize:
          if pendingConnectionCount < maxConnecting:
            connection = create connection
          else:
            # this waiting MUST NOT prevent other threads from checking Connections
            # back in to the pool.
            wait until pendingConnectionCount < maxConnecting or a connection is available
            continue
          
    except pool is closed:
      emit ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent(reason="poolClosed")
      throw PoolClosedError
    except timeout:
      emit ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent(reason="timeout")
      throw WaitQueueTimeoutError
    finally:
      # This must be done in all drivers
      leave wait queue

    # If there is no background thread, the pool MUST ensure that
    # there are at least minPoolSize total connections.
    # This MUST be done in a non-blocking manner
    while totalConnectionCount < minPoolSize:
      populate the pool with a connection

    # If the Connection has not been established yet (TCP, TLS,
    # handshake, compression, and auth), it must be established
    # before it is returned.
    # This MUST NOT block other threads from acquiring connections.
    if connection state is "pending":
      try:
        establish connection
      except connection establishment error:
        emit ConnectionCheckOutFailedEvent(reason="error")
        decrement totalConnectionCount
        throw
      finally:
        decrement pendingConnectionCount
    else:
        decrement availableConnectionCount
    set connection state to "in use"
    emit ConnectionCheckedOutEvent
    return connection

Checking In a Connection
------------------------

A Pool MUST have a method of allowing the driver to check in a
`Connection <#connection>`_. The driver MUST NOT be allowed to check in a
`Connection <#connection>`_ to a Pool that did not create that `Connection <#connection>`_, and
MUST throw an Error if this is attempted.

When the `Connection <#connection>`_ is checked in, it MUST be `closed
<#closing-a-connection-internal-implementation>`_ if any of the following are
true:

-  The `Connection <#connection>`_ is perished.
-  The pool has been closed.

Otherwise, the `Connection <#connection>`_ is marked as available.

.. code::

    emit ConnectionCheckedInEvent
    if connection is perished OR pool is closed:
      close connection
    else:
      mark connection as available

Clearing a Connection Pool
--------------------------

A Pool MUST have a method of clearing all `Connections <#connection>`_ when instructed. Rather than iterating through every `Connection <#connection>`_, this method should simply increment the generation of the Pool, implicitly marking all current `Connections <#connection>`_ as stale. The checkOut and checkIn algorithms will handle clearing out stale `Connections <#connection>`_. If a user is subscribed to Connection Monitoring events, a PoolClearedEvent MUST be emitted after incrementing the generation.

As part of clearing the pool, the WaitQueue MUST also be cleared, meaning all
requests in the WaitQueue MUST fail with errors indicating that the pool was
cleared while the checkOut was being performed. The error returned MUST be
considered a retryable error. Clearing the WaitQueue MUST happen eagerly so that
any operations waiting on `Connections <#connection>`_ can retry as soon as
possible. The pool MUST NOT rely on WaitQueueTimeoutMS to clear requests from
the WaitQueue.

Forking
-------

A `Connection <#connection>`_ is explicitly not fork-safe. The proper behavior in the case of a fork is to ResetAfterFork by:

-  clear all Connection Pools in the child process
-  closing all `Connections <#connection>`_ in the child-process.

Drivers that support forking MUST document that `Connections <#connection>`_ to an Endpoint are not fork-safe, and document the proper way to ResetAfterFork in the driver.

Drivers MAY aggressively ResetAfterFork if the driver detects it has been forked.

Optional Behaviors
------------------

The following features of a Connection Pool SHOULD be implemented if they make sense in the driver and driver's language.

Background Thread
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Pool SHOULD have a background Thread that is responsible for
monitoring the state of all available `Connections <#connection>`_. This background
thread SHOULD

-  Populate `Connections <#connection>`_ to ensure that the pool always satisfies **minPoolSize**
    - The background thread SHOULD just go back to sleep instead of waiting for
      pendingConnectionCount to become less than maxConnecting when satisfying
      minPoolSize.
-  Remove and close perished available `Connections <#connection>`_.

withConnection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Pool SHOULD implement a scoped resource management mechanism idiomatic to their language to prevent `Connections <#connection>`_ from not being checked in. Examples include `Python's "with" statement <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.6.html#pep-343-the-with-statement>`__ and `C#'s "using" statement <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement>`__. If implemented, drivers SHOULD use this method as the default method of checking out and checking in `Connections <#connection>`_.

.. _connection-pool-monitoring-1:

Connection Pool Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All drivers that implement a connection pool MUST provide an API that allows users to subscribe to events emitted from the pool. If a user subscribes to Connection Monitoring events, these events MUST be emitted when specified in “Connection Pool Behaviors”. Events SHOULD be created and subscribed to in a manner idiomatic to their language and driver.

Events
------


.. code:: typescript

    /**
     *  Emitted when a Connection Pool is created
     */
    interface PoolCreatedEvent {
      /**
       *  The ServerAddress of the Endpoint the pool is attempting to connect to.
       */
      address: string;

      /**
       *  Any non-default pool options that were set on this Connection Pool.
       */
      options: {...}
    }

    /**
     *  Emitted when a Connection Pool is cleared
     */

Connection Pool Errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A connection pool throws errors in specific circumstances. These Errors
MUST be emitted by the pool. Errors SHOULD be created and dispatched in
a manner idiomatic to the Driver and Language.

.. code:: typescript

    /**
     *  Thrown when the driver attempts to check out a
     *  Connection from a closed Connection Pool
     */
    interface PoolClosedError {
      message: 'Attempted to check out a Connection from closed connection pool';
      address: <pool address>;
    }

    /**
     *  Thrown when a driver times out when attempting to check out
     *  a Connection from a Pool
     */
    interface WaitQueueTimeoutError {
      message: 'Timed out while checking out a Connection from connection pool';
      address: <pool address>;
    }

Test Plan
=========

See `tests/README.rst <tests/README.rst>`_

Design Rationale
================

Why do we set minPoolSize across all members of a replicaSet, when most traffic will be against a Primary?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently, we are attempting to codify our current pooling behavior with minimal changes, and minPoolSize is currently uniform across all members of a replicaSet. This has the benefit of offsetting connection swarming during a Primary Step-Down, which will be further addressed in our `Advanced Pooling Behaviors <#advanced-pooling-behaviors>`__.

Why do we have separate ConnectionCreated and ConnectionReady events, but only one ConnectionClosed event?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ConnectionCreated and ConnectionReady each involve different state changes in the pool.

-  ConnectionCreated adds a new “pending” `Connection <#connection>`_, meaning
   the totalConnectionCount and pendingConnectionCount increase by one
-  ConnectionReady establishes that the `Connection <#connection>`_ is ready for use, meaning the availableConnectionCount increases by one

ConnectionClosed indicates that the `Connection <#connection>`_ is no longer a member of the pool, decrementing totalConnectionCount and potentially availableConnectionCount. After this point, the `Connection <#connection>`_ is no longer a part of the pool. Further hypothetical events would not indicate a change to the state of the pool, so they are not specified here.

Why are waitQueueSize and waitQueueMultiple deprecated?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options were originally only implemented in three drivers (Java, C#, and Python), and provided little value. While these fields would allow for faster diagnosis of issues in the connection pool, they would not actually prevent an error from occurring. 

Additionally, these options have the effect of prioritizing older requests over newer requests, which is not necessarily the behavior that users want. They can also result in cases where queue access oscillates back and forth between full and not full. If a driver has a full waitQueue, then all requests for `Connections <#connection>`_ will be rejected. If the client is continually spammed with requests, you could wind up with a scenario where as soon as the waitQueue is no longer full, it is immediately filled. It is not a favorable situation to be in, partially b/c it violates the fairness guarantee that the waitQueue normally provides. 

Because of these issues, it does not make sense to `go against driver mantras and provide an additional knob <../../README.rst#>`__. We may eventually pursue an alternative configurations to address wait queue size in `Advanced Pooling Behaviors <#advanced-pooling-behaviors>`__.

Users that wish to have this functionality can achieve similar results by utilizing other methods to limit concurrency. Examples include implementing either a thread pool or an operation queue with a capped size in the user application. Drivers that need to deprecate ``waitQueueSize`` and/or ``waitQueueMultiple`` SHOULD refer users to these examples.

Why is waitQueueTimeoutMS optional for some drivers?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are anticipating eventually introducing a single client-side timeout mechanism, making us hesitant to introduce another granular timeout control. Therefore, if a driver/language already has an idiomatic way to implement their timeouts, they should leverage that mechanism over implementing waitQueueTimeoutMS.

Why must populating the pool require the use of a background thread or async I/O?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Without the use of a background thread, the pool is `populated
<#populating-the-pool-with-a-connection-internal-implementation>`_ with enough
connections to satisfy minPoolSize during checkOut. `Connections <#connection>`_
are established as part of populating the pool though, so if `Connection
<#connection>`_ establishment were done in a blocking fashion, the first
operations after a clearing of the pool would experience unacceptably high
latency, especially for larger values of minPoolSize. Thus, populating the pool
must occur on a background thread (which is acceptable to block) or via the
usage of non-blocking (async) I/O.

Why should closing a connection be non-blocking?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because idle and perished `Connections <#connection>`_ are cleaned up as part of
checkOut, performing blocking I/O while closing such `Connections <#connection>`_
would block application threads, introducing unnecessary latency. Once
a `Connection <#connection>`_ is marked as "closed", it will not be checked out
again, so ensuring the socket is torn down does not need to happen
immediately and can happen at a later time, either via async I/O or a
background thread. 

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

As mentioned in `Deprecated Options <#deprecated-options>`__, some drivers currently implement the options ``waitQueueSize`` and/or ``waitQueueMultiple``. These options will need to be deprecated and phased out of the drivers that have implemented them.


Reference Implementations
=========================

- JAVA (JAVA-3079)
- RUBY (RUBY-1560)

Future Development
==================

SDAM
~~~~

This specification does not dictate how SDAM Monitoring connections are managed. SDAM specifies that “A monitor SHOULD NOT use the client's regular Connection pool”. Some possible solutions for this include:

-  Having each Endpoint representation in the driver create and manage a separate dedicated `Connection <#connection>`_ for monitoring purposes
-  Having each Endpoint representation in the driver maintain a separate pool of maxPoolSize 1 for monitoring purposes.
-  Having each Pool maintain a dedicated `Connection <#connection>`_ for monitoring purposes, with an API to expose that Connection.

Advanced Pooling Behaviors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This spec does not address all advanced pooling behaviors like predictive pooling or aggressive `Connection <#connection>`_ creation. Future work may address this.

Add support for OP_MSG exhaustAllowed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exhaust Cursors may require changes to how we close `Connections <#connection>`_ in the future, specifically to add a way to close and remove from its pool a `Connection <#connection>`_ which has unread exhaust messages.

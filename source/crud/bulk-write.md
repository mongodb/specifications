# Bulk Write

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 8.0

## Abstract

This specification defines the driver API for the `bulkWrite` server command introduced in MongoDB 8.0. The API defined
in this specification allows users to perform insert, update, and delete operations against mixed namespaces in a
minimized number of round trips, and to receive detailed results for each operation performed. This API is distinct from
the [collection-level bulkWrite method](../crud/crud.md#insert-update-replace-delete-and-bulk-writes) defined in the
CRUD specification and the [deprecated bulk write specification](../driver-bulk-update.rst).

## Specification

> [!NOTE]
> The `BulkWriteOptions`, `BulkWriteResult`, and `BulkWriteException` types defined in this specification are similar to
> those used for the `MongoCollection.bulkWrite` method. Statically typed drivers MUST NOT reuse their existing
> definitions for these types for the `MongoClient.bulkWrite` API and MUST introduce new types. If naming conflicts
> arise, drivers SHOULD prepend "Client" to the new type names (e.g. `ClientBulkWriteOptions`).

### `MongoClient.bulkWrite` Interface

```typescript
interface MongoClient {
    /**
     * Executes a list of mixed write operations.
     *
     * @throws BulkWriteException
     */
    bulkWrite(models: NamespaceWriteModelPair[], options: Optional<BulkWriteOptions>): BulkWriteResult;
}
```

### Write Models

A `WriteModel` defines a single write operation to be performed as part of a bulk write.

```typescript
/**
 * Unifying interface for the various write model types. Drivers may also use an enum with
 * variants for each write model for this type.
 */
interface WriteModel {}

class InsertOneModel implements WriteModel {
    /**
     * The document to insert.
     */
    document: Document;
}

class UpdateOneModel implements WriteModel {
    /**
     * The filter to apply.
     */
    filter: Document;

    /**
     * The update document or pipeline to apply to the selected document.
     */
    update: (Document | Document[]);

    /**
     * A set of filters specifying to which array elements an update should apply.
     *
     * This option is sent only if the caller explicitly provides a value.
     */
    arrayFilters: Optional<Document[]>;

    /**
     * Specifies a collation.
     *
     * This option is sent only if the caller explicitly provides a value.
     */
    collation: Optional<Document>;

    /**

     * specified, then the query system will only consider plans using the hinted index.

     */
    hint: Optional<Document | String>;

    /**
     * When true, creates a new document if no document matches the query.

     */
    hint: Optional<Document | String>;
}
```

Each write model provided to `MongoClient.bulkWrite` in the `models` parameter MUST have a corresponding namespace that
defines the collection on which the operation should be performed. Drivers SHOULD design this pairing in whichever way
is most idiomatic for its language. For example, drivers may:

- Include a required `namespace` field on each `WriteModel` variant and accept a list of `WriteModel` objects for the
  `models` parameter.
- Accept a list of `(Namespace, WriteModel)` tuples for `models`.
- Define the following pair class:

```typescript
class NamespaceWriteModelPair {
    /**
     * The namespace on which to perform the write.
     */
    namespace: Namespace;

    /**
     * The write to perform.
     */
    model: WriteModel;
}
```

Drivers MUST throw an exception if the list provided for `models` is empty.

#### Update vs. replace document validation

Update documents provided in `UpdateOne` and `UpdateMany` write models are required only to contain atomic modifiers
(i.e. keys that start with "$"). Drivers MUST throw an error if an update document is empty or if the document's first
key does not start with "$". Drivers MUST rely on the server to return an error if any other entries in the update
document are not atomic modifiers. Drivers are not required to perform validation on update pipelines.

Replacement documents provided in `ReplaceOne` write models are required not to contain atomic modifiers. Drivers MUST
throw an error if a replacement document is nonempty and its first key starts with "$". Drivers MUST rely on the server
to return an error if any other entries in the replacement document are atomic modifiers.

### Options

```typescript
class BulkWriteOptions {
    /**
     * Whether the operations in this bulk write should be executed in the order in which they were
     * specified. If false, writes will continue to be executed if an individual write fails. If
     * true, writes will stop executing if an individual write fails.
     *
     * Defaults to true.
     */
    ordered: Optional<Boolean>;

    /**
     * If true, allows the writes to opt out of document-level validation.
     *
     * This option is only sent if the caller explicitly provides a value. The server's default
     * value is false.
     */
    bypassDocumentValidation: Optional<Boolean>;

    /**
     * A map of parameter names and values to apply to all operations within the bulk write. Value
     * must be constant or closed expressions that do not reference document fields. Parameters can
     * then be accessed as variables in an aggregate expression context (e.g. "$$var").
     *
     * This option is only sent if the caller explicitly provides a value.
     */
    let: Optional<Document>;

    /**
     * The write concern to use for this bulk write.
     */
    writeConcern: Optional<WriteConcern>;

    /**
     * Enables users to specify an arbitrary comment to help trace the operation through
     * the database profiler, currentOp and logs.
     *
     * This option is only sent if the caller explicitly provides a value.
     */
    comment: Optional<BSON value>;

    /**
     * Whether detailed results for each successful operation should be included in the returned
     * BulkWriteResult.
     *
     * Defaults to false. This value corresponds inversely to the errorsOnly field in the bulkWrite
     * command.
     */
    verboseResults: Optional<Boolean>;
}
```

### Result

```typescript
class BulkWriteResult {
    /**
     * Indicates whether this write result was acknowledged. If not, then all other members of this
     * result will be undefined.
     *
     * NOT REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT. See below for more guidance on modeling unacknowledged results.
     */
    acknowledged: Boolean;

    /**
     * Indicates whether the results are verbose. If false, the insertResults, updateResults, and
     * deleteResults fields in this result will be undefined.
     *
     * NOT REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT. See below for other ways to differentiate summary results from
     * verbose results.
     */
    hasVerboseResults: Boolean;

    /**
     * The total number of documents inserted across all insert operations.
     */
    insertedCount: Int64;

    /**
     * The total number of documents upserted across all update operations.
     */
    upsertedCount: Int64;

    /**
     * The total number of documents matched across all update operations.
     */
    matchedCount: Int64;

    /**
     * The total number of documents modified across all update operations.
     */
    modifiedCount: Int64;

    /**
     * The total number of documents deleted across all delete operations.
     */
    deletedCount: Int64;

    /**
     * The results of each individual insert operation that was successfully performed.
     */
    insertResults: Map<Int64, InsertOneResult>;

    /**
     * The results of each individual update operation that was successfully performed.
     */
    updateResults: Map<Int64, UpdateResult>;

    /**
     * The results of each individual delete operation that was successfully performed.
     */
    deleteResults: Map<Int64, DeleteResult>;
}

class InsertOneResult {
    /**
     * The _id of the inserted document.
     */
    insertedId: Any;
}

class UpdateResult {
    /**
     * The number of documents that matched the filter.
     */
    matchedCount: Int64;

    /**
     * The number of documents that were modified.
     */
    modifiedCount: Int64;

    /**
     * The _id field of the upserted document if an upsert occurred.
     *
     * It MUST be possible to discern between a BSON Null upserted ID value and this field being
     * unset. If necessary, drivers MAY add a didUpsert boolean field to differentiate between
     * these two cases.
     */
    upsertedId: Optional<BSON value>;
}

class DeleteResult {
    /**
     * The number of documents that were deleted.
     */
    deletedCount: Int64;
}
```

#### Unacknowledged results

`BulkWriteResult` has an optional `acknowledged` field to indicate whether the result was acknowledged. This is not
required to implement. Drivers should follow the guidance in the CRUD specification
[here](../crud/crud.md#write-results) to determine how to model unacknowledged results.

#### Summary vs. verbose results

Users MUST be able to discern whether a `BulkWriteResult` contains summary or verbose results without inspecting the
value provided for `verboseResults` in `BulkWriteOptions`. Drivers MUST implement this in one of the following ways:

- Expose the `hasVerboseResults` field in `BulkWriteResult` as defined above. Document that `insertResults`,
  `updateResults`, and `deleteResults` will be undefined when `hasVerboseResults` is false. Raise an error if a user
  tries to access one of these fields when `hasVerboseResults` is false.
- Implement the `insertResults`, `updateResults`, and `deleteResults` fields as optional types and document that they
  will be unset when `verboseResults` is false.
- Introduce separate `SummaryBulkWriteResult` and `VerboseBulkWriteResult` types. `VerboseBulkWriteResult` MUST have all
  of the required fields defined on `BulkWriteResult` above. `SummaryBulkWriteResult` MUST have all of the required
  fields defined on `BulkWriteResult` above except `insertResults`, `updateResults`, and `deleteResults`.

#### Individual results

The `InsertOneResult`, `UpdateResult`, and `DeleteResult` classes are the same as or similar to types of the same name
defined in the [CRUD specification](crud.md). Drivers MUST redefine these classes if their existing result classes
deviate from the definitions in this specification (e.g. if they contain acknowledgement information, which is not
applicable for individual bulk write operations). Drivers MAY reuse their existing types for these classes if they match
the ones defined here exactly.

### Exception

```typescript
class BulkWriteException {
    /**
     * A top-level error that occurred when attempting to communicate with the server or execute
     * the bulk write. This value may not be populated if the exception was thrown due to errors
     * occurring on individual writes.
     */
    error: Optional<Error>;

    /**
     * Write concern errors that occurred while executing the bulk write. This list may have
     * multiple items if more than one server command was required to execute the bulk write.
     */
    writeConcernErrors: WriteConcernError[];

    /**
     * Errors that occurred during the execution of individual write operations. This map will
     * contain at most one entry if the bulk write was ordered.
     */
    writeErrors: Map<Int64, WriteError>;

    /**
     * The results of any successful operations that were performed before the error was
     * encountered.
     */
    partialResult: Optional<BulkWriteResult>;
}
```

## Building a `bulkWrite` Command

The `bulkWrite` server command has the following format:

```javascript
{
    "bulkWrite": 1,
    "ops": <Array>,
    "nsInfo": <Array>,
    "errorsOnly": Optional<Boolean>,
    "ordered": Optional<Boolean>,
    "bypassDocumentValidation": Optional<Boolean>,
    "comment": Optional<BSON value>,
    "let": Optional<Document>,
    ...additional operation-agnostic fields
}
```

Drivers MUST use document sequences ([`OP_MSG`](../message/OP_MSG.rst) payload type 1) for the `ops` and `nsInfo`
fields.

The `bulkWrite` command is executed on the "admin" database.

### Operations

The `ops` field is a list of write operation documents. The first entry in each document has the name of the operation
(i.e. "insert", "update", or "delete") as its key and the index in the `nsInfo` array of the namespace on which the
operation should be performed as its value. The documents have the following format:

#### Insert

```javascript
{
    "insert": <Int32>,
    "document": <Document>
}
```

If the document to be inserted does not contain an `_id` field, drivers MUST generate a new [`ObjectId`](../objectid.md)
and add it as the `_id` field at the beginning of the document.

#### Update

```javascript
{
    "update": <Int32>,
    "filter": <Document>,
    "updateMods": <Document | Array>,
    "multi": Optional<Boolean>,
    "upsert": Optional<Boolean>,
    "arrayFilters": Optional<Array>,
    "hint": Optional<Document | String>
}
```

#### Delete

```javascript
{
    "delete": <Int32>,
    "filter": <Document>,
    "multi": Optional<Boolean>,
    "hint": Optional<Document | String>,
    "collation": Optional<Document>
}
```

### Namespace Information

The `nsInfo` field is an array containing the namespaces on which the write operations should be performed. Drivers MUST
NOT include duplicate namespaces in this list. The documents in the `nsInfo` array have the following format:

```javascript
{
    "ns": <String>
}
```

### `errorsOnly` and `verboseResults`

The `errorsOnly` field indicates whether the results cursor returned in the `bulkWrite` response should contain only
errors and omit individual results. If false, both individual results for successful operations and errors will be
returned. This field is optional and defaults to false on the server.

`errorsOnly` corresponds inversely to the `verboseResults` option defined on `BulkWriteOptions`. If the user specified a
value for `verboseResults`, drivers MUST define `errorsOnly` as the opposite of `verboseResults`. If the user did not
specify a value for `verboseResults`, drivers MUST define `errorsOnly` as `true`.

### `ordered`

The `ordered` field defines whether writes should be executed in the order in which they were specified, and, if an
error occurs, whether the server should halt execution of further writes. It is optional and defaults to true on the
server. Drivers MUST explicitly define `ordered` as `true` in the `bulkWrite` command if a value is not specified in
`BulkWriteOptions`. This is required to avoid inconsistencies between server and driver behavior if the server default
changes in the future.

### Size Limits

The server reports a `maxBsonObjectSize` in its `hello` response. This value defines the maximum size for documents that
are inserted into the database. Documents that are sent to the server but are not intended to be inserted into the
database (e.g. command documents) have a size limit of `maxBsonObjectSize + 16KiB`. When an acknowledged write concern
is used, drivers MUST NOT perform any checks related to these size limits and MUST rely on the server to raise an error
if a limit is exceeded. However, when an unacknowledged write concern is used, drivers MUST raise an error if one of the
following limits is exceeded:

- The size of a document to be inserted MUST NOT exceed `maxBsonObjectSize`. This applies to the `document` field of an
  `InsertOneModel` and the `replacement` field of a `ReplaceOneModel`.
- The size of an entry in the `ops` array MUST NOT exceed `maxBsonObjectSize + 16KiB`.
- The size of the `bulkWrite` command document MUST NOT exceed `maxBsonObjectSize + 16KiB`.

See [SERVER-10643](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-10643) for more details on these size limits.

## Auto-Encryption

If `MongoClient.bulkWrite` is called on a `MongoClient` configured with `AutoEncryptionOpts`, drivers MUST return an
error with the message: "bulkWrite does not currently support automatic encryption".

This is expected to be removed once [DRIVERS-2888](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2888) is implemented.

## Command Batching

Drivers MUST accept an arbitrary number of operations as input to the `MongoClient.bulkWrite` method. Because the server
imposes restrictions on the size of write operations, this means that a single call to `MongoClient.bulkWrite` may
require multiple `bulkWrite` commands to be sent to the server. Drivers MUST split bulk writes into separate commands
when the user's list of operations exceeds one or more of these maximums: `maxWriteBatchSize`, `maxBsonObjectSize` (for
`OP_MSG` payload type 0), and `maxMessageSizeBytes` (for `OP_MSG` payload type 1). Each of these values can be retrieved
from the selected server's `hello` command response. Drivers MUST merge results from multiple batches into a single
`BulkWriteResult` or `BulkWriteException` to return from `MongoClient.bulkWrite`.

When constructing the `nsInfo` array for a `bulkWrite` batch, drivers MUST only include the namespaces that are
referenced in the `ops` array for that batch.

### Number of Writes

`maxWriteBatchSize` defines the total number of writes allowed in one command. Drivers MUST split a bulk write into
multiple commands if the user provides more than `maxWriteBatchSize` operations in the argument for `models`.

### Total Message Size

Drivers MUST ensure that the total size of the `OP_MSG` built for each `bulkWrite` command does not exceed
`maxMessageSizeBytes`.

The upper bound for the size of an `OP_MSG` includes opcode-related bytes (e.g. the `OP_MSG` header) and
operation-agnostic command field bytes (e.g. `txnNumber`, `lsid`). Drivers MUST limit the combined size of the
`bulkWrite` command document (excluding command-agnostic fields), `ops` document sequence, and `nsInfo` document
sequence to `maxMessageSizeBytes - 1000` to account for this overhead. The following pseudocode demonstrates how to
apply this limit in batch-splitting logic:

```
MESSAGE_OVERHEAD_BYTES = 1000

bulkWriteCommand = Document { "bulkWrite": 1 }
bulkWriteCommand.appendOptions(bulkWriteOptions)

maxOpsNsInfoBytes = maxMessageSizeBytes - (MESSAGE_OVERHEAD_BYTES + bulkWriteCommand.numBytes())

while (writeModels.hasNext()) {
    ops = DocumentSequence {}
    nsInfo = DocumentSequence {}
    while (true) {
        if (!writeModels.hasNext()) {
            break
        }
        model = writeModels.next()

        modelDoc = writeModel.toOpsDoc()
        bytesAdded = modelDoc.numBytes()

        nsInfoDoc = null
        if (!nsInfo.contains(model.namespace)) {
            nsInfoDoc = model.namespace.toNsInfoDoc()
            bytesAdded += nsInfoDoc.numBytes()
        }

        newSize = ops.numBytes() + nsInfo.numBytes() + bytesAdded
        if (newSize > maxOpsNsInfoBytes) {
            break
        } else {
            ops.push(modelDoc)
            if (nsInfoDoc != null) {
                nsInfo.push(nsInfoDoc)
            }
        }
    }

    // construct and send OP_MSG
}
```

See [this Q&A entry](#how-was-the-op_msg-overhead-allowance-determined) for more details on how the overhead allowance
was determined.

Drivers MUST return an error if there is not room to add at least one operation to `ops`.

## Handling the `bulkWrite` Server Response

The server's response to `bulkWrite` has the following format:

```javascript
{
    "ok": <0 | 1>,
    "cursor": {
        "id": <Int64>,
        "firstBatch": <Array>,
        "ns": <String>
    },
    "nErrors": <Int32>,
    "nInserted": <Int32>,
    "nUpserted": <Int32>,
    "nMatched": <Int32>,
    "nModified": <Int32>,
    "nDeleted": <Int32>,
    ...additional command-agnostic fields
}
```

If any operations were successful (i.e. `nErrors` is less than the number of operations that were sent), drivers MUST
record the summary count fields in a `BulkWriteResult` to be returned to the user or embedded in a `BulkWriteException`.
Drivers MUST NOT populate the `partialResult` field in `BulkWriteException` if no operations were successful.

Drivers MUST attempt to consume the contents of the cursor returned in the server's `bulkWrite` response before
returning to the user. This is required regardless of whether the user requested verbose or summary results, as the
results cursor always contains any write errors that occurred. If the cursor contains a nonzero cursor ID, drivers MUST
perform `getMore` until the cursor has been exhausted. Drivers MUST use the same session used for the `bulkWrite`
command for each `getMore` call. When connected to a load balancer, drivers MUST use the connection used for the
`bulkWrite` command to create the cursor to ensure the same server is targeted.

The documents in the results cursor have the following format:

```javascript
{
    "ok": <0 | 1>,
    "idx": Int32,
    "code": Optional<Int32>,
    "errmsg": Optional<String>,
    "errInfo": Optional<Document>,
    "n": <Int32>,
    "nModified": Optional<Int32>,
    "upserted": Optional<Document with "_id" field>
}
```

If an error occurred (i.e. the value for `ok` is 0), the `code`, `errmsg`, and optionally `errInfo` fields will be
populated with details about the failure.

If the write succeeded, (i.e. the value for `ok` is 1), `n`, `nModified`, and `upsertedId` will be populated with the
following values based on the type of write:

| Response Field | Insert                                      | Update                                                                                                 | Delete                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `n`            | The number of documents that were inserted. | The number of documents that matched the filter.                                                       | The number of documents that were deleted. |
| `nModified`    | Not present.                                | The number of documents that were modified.                                                            | Not present.                               |
| `upserted`     | Not present.                                | A document containing the `_id` value for the upserted document. Only present if an upsert took place. | Not present.                               |

Note that the responses do not contain information about the type of operation that was performed. Drivers may need to
maintain the user's list of write models to infer which type of result should be recorded based on the value of `idx`.

### Handling Insert Results

Unlike the other result types, `InsertOneResult` contains an `insertedId` field that is generated driver-side, either by
recording the `_id` field present in the user's insert document or creating and adding one. Drivers MUST only record
these `insertedId` values in a `BulkWriteResult` when a successful response for the insert operation (i.e.
`{ "ok": 1, "n": 1 }`) is received in the results cursor. This ensures that drivers only report an `insertedId` when it
is confirmed that the insert succeeded.

## Handling Errors

### Top-Level Errors

A top-level error is any error that occurs that is not the result of a single write operation failing or a write concern
error. Examples include network errors that occur when communicating with the server, command errors (`{ "ok": 0 }`)
returned from the server, client-side errors, and errors that occur when attempting to perform a `getMore` to retrieve
results from the server.

When a top-level error is caused by a command error (i.e. an `{ "ok": 0 }` server response), drivers MUST provide access
to the raw server reply in the error returned to the user.

When a top-level error is encountered and individual results and/or errors have already been observed, drivers MUST
embed the top-level error within a `BulkWriteException` as the `error` field to retain this information. Otherwise,
drivers MAY throw an exception containing only the top-level error.

Encountering a top-level error MUST halt execution of a bulk write for both ordered and unordered bulk writes. This
means that drivers MUST NOT attempt to retrieve more responses from the cursor or execute any further `bulkWrite`
batches and MUST immediately throw an exception. If the results cursor has not been exhausted on the server when a
top-level error occurs, drivers MUST send the `killCursors` command to attempt to close it. The result returned from the
`killCursors` command MAY be ignored.

### Write Concern Errors

Write concern errors are recorded in the `writeConcernErrors` field on `BulkWriteException`. When a write concern error
is encountered, it should not terminate execution of the bulk write for either ordered or unordered bulk writes.
However, drivers MUST throw an exception at the end of execution if any write concern errors were observed.

### Individual Write Errors

Individual write errors retrieved from the cursor are recorded in the `writeErrors` field on `BulkWriteException`. If an
individual write error is encountered during an ordered bulk write, drivers MUST record the error in `writeErrors` and
immediately throw the exception. Otherwise, drivers MUST continue to iterate the results cursor and execute any further
`bulkWrite` batches.

## Test Plan

The majority of tests for `MongoClient.bulkWrite` are written in the
[Unified Test Format](../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.md) and reside in the
[CRUD unified tests directory](../crud/tests/unified/).

Additional prose tests are specified [here](../crud/tests/README.md). These tests require constructing very large
documents to test batch splitting, which is not feasible in the unified test format at the time of writing this
specification.

## Future Work

### Retry `bulkWrite` when `getMore` fails with a retryable error

When a `getMore` fails with a retryable error when attempting to iterate the results cursor, drivers could retry the
entire `bulkWrite` command to receive a fresh cursor and retry iteration. This work was omitted to minimize the scope of
the initial implementation and testing of the new bulk write API, but may be revisited in the future.

## Q&A

### Is `bulkWrite` supported on Atlas Serverless?

No. See [CLOUDP-256344](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CLOUDP-256344)

### Why are we adding a new bulk write API rather than updating the `MongoCollection.bulkWrite` implementation?

The new `bulkWrite` command is only available in MongoDB 8.0+, so it cannot function as a drop-in replacement for the
existing bulk write implementation that uses the `insert`, `update`, and `delete` commands. Additionally, because the
new `bulkWrite` command allows operations against multiple collections and databases, `MongoClient` is a more
appropriate place to expose its functionality.

### Why can't drivers reuse existing bulk write types?

This specification introduces several types that are similar to existing types used in the `MongoCollection.bulkWrite`
API. Although these types are similar now, they may diverge in the future with the introduction of new options and
features to the `bulkWrite` command. Introducing new types also provides more clarity to users on the existing
differences between the collection-level and client-level bulk write APIs. For example, the `verboseResults` option is
only available for `MongoClient.bulkWrite`.

### Why are bulk write operation results returned in a cursor?

Returning results via a cursor rather than an array in the `bulkWrite` response allows full individual results and
errors to be returned without the risk of the response exceeding the maximum BSON object size. Using a cursor also
leaves open the opportunity to add `findAndModify` to the list of supported write operations in the future.

### Why was the `verboseResults` option introduced, and why is its default `false`?

The `bulkWrite` command returns top-level summary result counts and, optionally, individual results for each operation.
Compiling the individual results server-side and consuming these results driver-side is less performant than only
recording the summary counts. We expect that most users are not interested in the individual results of their operations
and that most users will rely on defaults, so `verboseResults` defaults to `false` to improve performance in the common
case.

### Why should drivers send `bypassDocumentValidation: false` for `bulkWrite`?

[DRIVERS-450](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-450) introduced a requirement that drivers only send a value for
`bypassDocumentValidation` on write commands if it was specified as true. The original motivation for this change is not
documented. This specification requires that drivers send `bypassDocumentValidation` in the `bulkWrite` command if it is
set by the user in `BulkWriteOptions`, regardless of its value.

Explicitly defining `bypassDocumentValidation: false` aligns with the server's default to perform schema validation and
thus has no effect. However, checking the value of an option that the user specified and omitting it from the command
document if it matches the server's default creates unnecessary work for drivers. Always sending the user's specified
value also safeguards against the unlikely event that the server changes the default value for
`bypassDocumentValidation` in the future.

### Why is providing access to the raw server response when a command error occurs required?

This allows users to access new error fields that the server may add in the future without needing to upgrade their
driver version. See [DRIVERS-2385](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2385) for more details.

### Why are drivers required to send `nsInfo` as a document sequence?

`nsInfo` could exceed `maxBsonObjectSize` if a user is doing `maxWriteBatchSize` operations, each operation is on a
unique namespace, and each namespace is near the
[maximum length](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/limits/#mongodb-limit-Restriction-on-Collection-Names)
allowed for namespaces given the values for these limits at the time of writing this specification. Providing `nsInfo`
as a document sequence reduces the likelihood that a driver would need to batch split a user's bulk write in this
scenario.

### How was the `OP_MSG` overhead allowance determined?

The Command Batching [Total Message Size](#total-message-size) section uses a 1000 byte overhead allowance to
approximate the number of non-`bulkWrite`-specific bytes contained in an `OP_MSG` sent for a `bulkWrite` batch. This
number was determined by constructing `OP_MSG` messages with various fields attached to the command, including
`startTransaction`, `autocommit`, and `apiVersion`. Additional room was allocated to allow for future additions to the
`OP_MSG` structure or the introduction of new command-agnostic fields.

Drivers are required to use this value even if they are capable of determining the exact size of the message prior to
batch-splitting to standardize implementations across drivers and simplify batch-splitting testing.

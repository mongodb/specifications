# CRUD API

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 2.6

______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

The CRUD API defines a set of related methods and structures defining a driver's API. As not all languages/frameworks
have the same abilities, parts of the spec may or may not apply. These sections have been called out.

## Specification

This specification is about [Guidance](#guidance) in 3 areas related to the CRUD API as well as a specification for the
API itself. It does not define implementation details and provides room and flexibility for the idioms and differences
in languages and frameworks.

### Definitions

#### META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

#### Terms

**Collection:**

The term `interface Collection` will be seen in most of the sections. Each driver will likely have a class or interface
defined for the concept of a collection. Operations appearing inside the `interface Collection` are required operations
to be present on a driver's concept of a collection.

**Iterable:**

The term `Iterable` will be seen as a return type from some of the [Read](#read) methods. Its use is as that of a
sequence of items. For instance, `collection.find({})` returns a sequence of documents that can be iterated over.

### Guidance

#### Documentation

The documentation provided in code below is merely for driver authors and SHOULD NOT be taken as required documentation
for the driver.

#### Operations

All drivers MUST offer the operations defined in the following sections. This does not preclude a driver from offering
more.

#### Operation Parameters

All drivers MUST offer the same options for each operation as defined in the following sections. This does not preclude
a driver from offering more. A driver SHOULD NOT require a user to specify optional parameters, denoted by the
`Optional<>` signature. Unless otherwise specified, optional values should not be sent to the server.

##### Deviations

A non-exhaustive list of acceptable deviations are as follows:

- Using named parameters instead of an options hash. For instance, `collection.find({x:1}, sort: {a: -1})`.

- When using an `Options` class, if multiple `Options` classes are structurally equatable, it is permissible to
  consolidate them into one with a clear name. For instance, it would be permissible to use the name `UpdateOptions` as
  the options for `UpdateOne` and `UpdateMany`.

- Using a fluent style builder for find or aggregate:

  ```typescript
  collection.find({x: 1}).sort({a: -1}).skip(10);
  ```

  When using a fluent-style builder, all options should be named rather than inventing a new word to include in the
  pipeline (like options). Required parameters are still required to be on the initiating method.

  In addition, it is imperative that documentation indicate when the order of operations is important. For instance,
  skip and limit in find is order irrelevant where skip and limit in aggregate is not.

#### Naming

All drivers MUST name operations, objects, and parameters as defined in the following sections.

Deviations are permitted as outlined below.

##### Deviations

When deviating from a defined name, an author should consider if the altered name is recognizable and discoverable to
the user of another driver.

A non-exhaustive list of acceptable naming deviations are as follows:

- Using "batchSize" as an example, Java would use "batchSize" while Python would use "batch_size". However, calling it
  "batchCount" would not be acceptable.
- Using "maxTimeMS" as an example, .NET would use "MaxTime" where it's type is a TimeSpan structure that includes units.
  However, calling it "MaximumTime" would not be acceptable.
- Using "FindOptions" as an example, Javascript wouldn't need to name it while other drivers might prefer to call it
  "FindArgs" or "FindParams". However, calling it "QueryOptions" would not be acceptable.
- Using "isOrdered" rather than "ordered". Some languages idioms prefer the use of "is", "has", or "was" and this is
  acceptable.

#### Timeouts

Drivers MUST enforce timeouts for all operations per the
[Client Side Operations Timeout](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md) specification. All
operations that return cursors MUST support the timeout options documented in the
[Cursors](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md#cursors) section of that specification.
All explain helpers MUST support the timeout options documented in the
[Explain Helpers](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md#explain) section of that
specification.

### API

#### Read

> [!NOTE]
> The term `Iterable<T>` is used below to indicate many of T. This spec is flexible on what that means as different
> drivers will have different requirements, types, and idioms.

   * iterate the return value, results would be returned.

##### Count API Details

MongoDB drivers provide two helpers for counting the number of documents in a collection, estimatedDocumentCount and
countDocuments. The names were chosen to make it clear how they behave and exactly what they do. The
estimatedDocumentCount helper returns an estimate of the count of documents in the collection using collection metadata,
rather than counting the documents or consulting an index. The countDocuments helper counts the documents that match the
provided query filter using an aggregation pipeline.

The count() helper is deprecated. It has always been implemented using the `count` command. The behavior of the count
command differs depending on the options passed to it and may or may not provide an accurate count. When no query filter
is provided the count command provides an estimate using collection metadata. Even when provided with a query filter the
count command can return inaccurate results with a sharded cluster
[if orphaned documents exist or if a chunk migration is in progress](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/count/#behavior).
The countDocuments helper avoids these sharded cluster problems entirely when used with MongoDB 3.6+, and when using
`Primary` read preference with older sharded clusters.

##### estimatedDocumentCount

The estimatedDocumentCount function is implemented using the `count` command with no query filter, skip, limit, or other
options that would alter the results. The only supported options are listed in the `EstimatedDocumentCountOptions` type
defined above.

Drivers MUST document that, due to an oversight in versions 5.0.0-5.0.8 of MongoDB, the `count` command, which
estimatedDocumentCount uses in its implementation, was not included in v1 of the Stable API, and so users of the Stable
API with estimatedDocumentCount are recommended to upgrade their server version to 5.0.9+ or set `apiStrict: false` to
avoid encountering errors.

Drivers MUST document that the `count` server command is used to implement estimatedDocumentCount and that users can
find more information via [Count: Behavior](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/count/#behavior).

The 5.0-compat versions of many drivers updated their estimatedDocumentCount implementations to use the `$collStats`
aggregation stage instead of the `count` command. This had the unintended consequence of breaking estimatedDocumentCount
on views, and so the change was seen as a backwards-incompatible regression and reverted. The release notes for the
driver versions that include the reversion from `$collStats` back to `count` MUST document the following:

- The 5.0-compat release accidentally broke estimatedDocumentCount on views by changing its implementation to use
  `aggregate` and a `$collStats` stage instead of the `count` command.
- The new release is fixing estimatedDocumentCount on views by reverting back to using `count` in its implementation.
- Due to an oversight, the `count` command was omitted from the Stable API in server versions 5.0.0 - 5.0.8 and 5.1.0 -
  5.3.1, so users of the Stable API with estimatedDocumentCount are recommended to upgrade their MongoDB clusters to
  5.0.9 or 5.3.2 (if on Atlas) or set `apiStrict: false` when constructing their MongoClients.

##### countDocuments

The countDocuments function is implemented using the `$group` aggregate pipeline stage with `$sum`. Applications must be
required to pass a value for filter, but an empty document is supported:

```typescript
pipeline = [{'$match': filter}]
if (skip) {
  pipeline.push({'$skip': skip})
}
if (limit) {
  pipeline.push({'$limit': limit})
}
pipeline.push({'$group': {'_id': 1, 'n': {'$sum': 1}}})
```

The count of documents is returned in the `n` field, similar to the `count` command. countDocuments options other than
filter, skip, and limit are added as options to the `aggregate` command.

In the event this aggregation is run against an empty collection, an empty array will be returned with no `n` field.
Drivers MUST interpret this result as a `0` count.

##### Combining Limit and Batch Size for the Wire Protocol

The OP_QUERY wire protocol only contains a numberToReturn value which drivers must calculate to get expected limit and
batch size behavior. Subsequent calls to OP_GET_MORE should use the user-specified batchSize or default to 0. If the
result is larger than the max Int32 value, an error MUST be raised as the computed value is impossible to send to the
server. Below is pseudo-code for calculating numberToReturn for OP_QUERY.

```typescript
function calculateFirstNumberToReturn(options: FindOptions): Int32 {
  Int32 numberToReturn;
  Int32 limit = options.limit || 0;
  Int32 batchSize = options.batchSize || 0;

  if (limit < 0) {
    numberToReturn = limit;
  }
  else if (limit == 0) {
    numberToReturn = batchSize;
  }
  else if (batchSize == 0) {
    numberToReturn = limit;
  }
  else if (limit < batchSize) {
    numberToReturn = limit;
  }
  else {
    numberToReturn = batchSize;
  }

  return numberToReturn;
}
```

Because of this anomaly in the wire protocol, it is up to the driver to enforce the user-specified limit. Each driver
MUST keep track of how many documents have been iterated and stop iterating once the limit has been reached. When the
limit has been reached, if the cursor is still open, a driver MUST kill the cursor.

##### Database-level aggregation

The server supports several collection-less aggregation source stages like `$currentOp` and `$listLocalSessions`. The
database aggregate command requires a collection name of 1 for collection-less source stages. Drivers support for
database-level aggregation will allow users to receive a cursor from these collection-less aggregation source stages.

#### Write

###### Write Results

The acknowledged property is defined for languages/frameworks without a sufficient optional type. Hence, a driver may
choose to return an optional result (e.g. `Optional<BulkWriteResult>`) such that unacknowledged writes don't have a
value and acknowledged writes do have a value.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a choice, consider providing the acknowledged member and raising an error if the other fields are accessed
> in an unacknowledged write. Instead of users receiving a null reference exception, you have the opportunity to provide
> an informative error message indicating the correct way to handle the situation. For instance, "The insertedCount
> member is not available when the write was unacknowledged. Check the acknowledged member to avoid this error."

Any result class with all parameters marked NOT REQUIRED is ultimately NOT REQUIRED as well. For instance, the
`InsertOneResult` has all NOT REQUIRED parameters and is therefore also NOT REQUIRED allowing a driver to use "void" as
the return value for the `insertOne` method.

```typescript

   */
  upsertedCount: Int64;

```

##### Error Handling

Defined below are error and exception types that should be reported from the various write methods. Since error types
across languages would be impossible to reconcile, the below definitions represent the fields and names for the
information that should be present. Structure isn't important as long as the information is available.

Drivers SHOULD report errors however they report other server errors: by raising an exception, returning "false" and
populating an error struct, or another idiom that is consistent with other server errors.

###### WriteConcernError

```typescript
class WriteConcernError {

  /**
   * An integer value identifying the write concern error. Corresponds to the
   * "writeConcernError.code" field in the command response.
   *
   * @see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/WriteResult/
   */
  code: Int32;

  /**
   * A document identifying the write concern setting related to the error.
   * Corresponds to the "writeConcernError.errInfo" field in the command
   * response.
   *
   * @see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/WriteResult/
   */
  details: Document;

  /**
   * A description of the error. Corresponds to the
   * "writeConcernError.errmsg" field in the command response.
   *
   * @see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/WriteResult/
   */
  message: String;

}
```

Drivers MUST construct a `WriteConcernError` from a server reply as follows:

- Set `code` to `writeConcernError.code`.
- Set `message` to `writeConcernError.errmsg` if available.
- Set `details` to `writeConcernError.errInfo` if available. Drivers MUST NOT parse inside `errInfo`.

See [writeConcernError Examples](../read-write-concern/read-write-concern.md#writeconcernerror-examples) in the
Read/Write Concern spec for examples of how a server represents write concern errors in replies.

###### WriteError

Write errors for `insert`, `update`, and `delete` commands are reported as objects within a `writeErrors` array field in
the command response. Drivers MUST construct a `WriteError` from a server reply as follows (where `writeErrors[]` refers
to a particular element in the array):

- Set `code` to `writeErrors[].code`.
- Set `message` to `writeErrors[].errmsg` if available.
- Set `details` to `writeErrors[].errInfo` if available. Drivers MUST NOT parse inside `errInfo`.

For single-statement writes (i.e. `insertOne`, `updateOne`, `updateMany`, `replaceOne`, `deleteOne`, and `deleteMany`),
a single write error may be reported in the array and `writeErrors[0].index` will be zero.

For multi-statement writes (i.e. `insertMany` and `bulkWrite`), potentially many write errors may be reported in the
array and the `index` property will be set accordingly. Since the reported `index` is specific to each command, drivers
MUST adjust the index accordingly for `BulkWriteError.index`.

```typescript
class WriteError {

  /**
   * An integer value identifying the write error. Corresponds to the
   * "writeErrors[].code" field in the command response.
   *
   * @see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/WriteResult/
   */
  code: Int32;

  /**
   * A document providing more information about the write error (e.g. details
   * pertaining to document validation). Corresponds to the
   * "writeErrors[].errInfo" field in the command response.
   *
   * @see https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/WriteResult/
   */
  details: Document;

  /**
   * A description of the error. Corresponds to the "writeErrors[].errmsg"
   * field in the command response.
   *

   */
  message: String;

}

class BulkWriteError : WriteError {

  /**
   * The index of the request that errored. This is derived in part from the

##### Update vs. Replace Validation

The `update` family of operations require that the update document parameter MUST have only atomic modifiers. In
practice, this means that introspection needs to happen on that document to enforce this. However, it is enough to only
check the first element in the document. If it begins with a `$` sign and the rest of the document's elements do not,
the server will throw an error. Note that it is required that an update document have at least one atomic modifier.

The `replace` family of operations require that the replacement document parameter MUST NOT begin with an atomic
modifier. In practice, this means that introspection needs to happen on that document to enforce this. However, it is
enough to only check the first element in the document. If it does not begin with a `$` sign but an element later on
does, the server will throw an error.

##### Aggregation Pipelines with Write Stages

This section discusses special considerations for aggregation pipelines that contain write stages (e.g. `$out`,
`$merge`).

###### Returning a cursor on the output collection

As noted in the documentation for the `aggregate` helper earlier in this document, `$out` and `$merge` are special
pipeline stages that cause no results to be returned from the server. As such, drivers MAY setup a cursor to be executed
upon iteration against the output collection and return that instead of an iterable that would otherwise have no
results.

Drivers that do so for `$merge` MAY remind users that such a cursor may return more documents than were written by the
aggregation (e.g. documents that existed in the collection prior to `$merge` being executed).

###### Read preferences and server selection

This section is only applicable if an explicit (i.e. per-operation) or inherited (e.g. from a Collection) read
preference is available and it is *not* a primary read preference (i.e. `{ "mode": "primary" }`).

Historically, only primaries could execute an aggregation pipeline with `$out` or `$merge` and drivers never considered
a read preference for the operation. As of `featureCompatibilityVersion` 4.4, secondaries can now execute pipelines with
`$out` or `$merge`. Since drivers do not track `featureCompatibilityVersion`, the decision to consider a read preference
for such a pipeline will depend on the wire version(s) of the server(s) to which the driver is connected.

If there are one or more available servers and one or more of those servers is pre-5.0 (i.e. wire version \< 13),
drivers MUST NOT use the available read preference and MUST instead select a server using a primary read preference.

Otherwise, if there are either no available servers, all available servers are 5.0+ (i.e. wire version >= 13), or the
topology type is LoadBalanced (we can assume the backing mongos is 5.0+), drivers MUST use the available read
preference.

Drivers SHOULD augment their
[server selection algorithm](../server-selection/server-selection.md#server-selection-algorithm) such that this logic
can be enforced within a single server selection attempt.

Drivers MUST discern the read preference used to select a server for the operation, which SHALL be used for specifying
the [$readPreference global command argument](../message/OP_MSG.md#global-command-arguments) and
[passing read preference to mongos and load balancers](../server-selection/server-selection.md#passing-read-preference-to-mongos-and-load-balancers)
(if applicable).

### Explain

> [!NOTE]
> Explain helpers are optional. Drivers that do not provide explain helpers may ignore this section.

```typescript
interface ExplainOptions {
  /**
   * The maximum amount of time to allow the explain to run.
   *
   * This option is sent only if the caller explicitly provides a value. The default is to not send a value.
   *
   * NOTE: This option is deprecated in favor of timeoutMS.
   */
  maxTimeMS: Optional<Int64>;
}
```

Drivers MUST ensure that its helper permits users to specify a timeout (maxTimeMS or timeoutMS) for the explain command
specifically. An example, using Node, might look like:

```typescript
collection.find({ name: 'john doe' }).explain({ maxTimeMS: 1000 });

// sends:
{ 
  explain: { find: <collection>, query: { name: 'john doe' } },
  maxTimeMS: 1000
}

collection.find({ name: 'john doe' }).explain({ timeoutMS: 1000 });

// sends:
{ 
  explain: { find: <collection>, query: { name: 'john doe' } },
  maxTimeMS: <1000 - min rtt>
}
```

Drivers MUST document how users can specify options on their explain helpers.

## Test Plan

See the [README](tests/README.md) for tests.

## Motivation

Current drivers have chosen slightly different names and semantics for the same operations and options. In addition, not
all drivers offer all the same operations and methods. As such, it is difficult to transition from driver to driver
making the jobs of polyglot developers, documentation authors, and support engineers more difficult.

## Backwards Compatibility

This spec should be mostly backwards compatible as it is very lenient. Drivers finding a backwards compatibility problem
should attempt to work around it using an acceptable deviation. In rare cases, a driver may need to break backwards
compatibility. This should be done in accordance with a versioning scheme indicating that a backwards compatible break
may have occurred in conjunction with release documentation and warnings.

## Reference Implementation

See Test Plan

## Related Terminology

If a driver needs to refer to items in the following list, the below are the accepted forms of those terms and
deviations from the Naming section are still permissible.

- Read Preference: readPreference
- Read Concern: readConcern
- Write Concern: writeConcern

## Q & A

Q: Why do the names of the fields differ from those defined in the MongoDB manual?

Documentation and commands often refer to same-purposed fields with different names making it difficult to have a
cohesive API. In addition, occasionally the name was correct at one point and its purpose has expanded to a point where
the initial name doesn't accurately describe its current function.

In addition, responses from the servers are sometimes cryptic and used for the purposes of compactness. In these cases,
we felt the more verbose form was desirable for self-documentation purposes.

Q: Where is read preference?

Read preference is about selecting a server with which to perform a read operation, such as a query, a count, or an
aggregate. Since all operations defined in this specification are performed on a collection, it's uncommon that two
different read operations on the same collection would use a different read preference, potentially getting out-of-sync
results. As such, the most natural place to indicate read preference is on the client, the database, or the collection
itself and not the operations within it.

However, it might be that a driver needs to expose this selection filter to a user per operation for various reasons. As
noted before, it is permitted to specify this, along with other driver-specific options, in some alternative way.

Q: Where is read concern?

Read concern is about indicating how reads are handled. Since all operations defined in this specification are performed
on a collection, it's uncommon that two different read operations on the same collection would use a different read
concern, potentially causing mismatched and out-of-sync data. As such, the most natural place to indicate read concern
is on the client, the database, or the collection itself and not the operations within it.

However, it might be that a driver needs to expose read concern to a user per operation for various reasons. As noted
before, it is permitted to specify this, along with other driver-specific options, in some alternative way.

Q: Where is write concern?

Write concern is about indicating how writes are acknowledged. Since all operations defined in this specification are
performed on a collection, it's uncommon that two different write operations on the same collection would use a
different write concern, potentially causing mismatched and out-of-sync data. As such, the most natural place to
indicate write concern is on the client, the database, or the collection itself and not the operations within it. See
the [Read/Write Concern specification](../read-write-concern/read-write-concern.md) for the API of constructing a
read/write concern and associated API.

However, it might be that a driver needs to expose write concern to a user per operation for various reasons. As noted
before, it is permitted to specify this, along with other driver-specific options, in some alternative way.

Q: How do I throttle unacknowledged writes now that write concern is no longer defined on a per operation basis?

Some users used to throttle unacknowledged writes by using an acknowledged write concern every X number of operations.
Going forward, the proper way to handle this is by using the bulk write API.

Q: What is the logic for adding "One" or "Many" into the method and model names?

If the maximum number of documents affected can only be one, we added "One" into the name. This makes it explicit that
the maximum number of documents that could be affected is one vs. infinite.

In addition, the current API exposed by all our drivers has the default value for "one" or "many" set differently for
update and delete. This generally causes some issues for new developers and is a minor annoyance for existing
developers. The safest way to combat this without introducing discrepancies between drivers/driver versions or breaking
backwards compatibility was to use multiple methods, each signifying the number of documents that could be affected.

Q: Speaking of "One", where is `findOne`?

If your driver wishes to offer a `findOne` method, that is perfectly fine. If you choose to implement `findOne`, please
keep to the naming conventions followed by the `FindOptions` and keep in mind that certain things don't make sense like
limit (which should be -1), tailable, awaitData, etc...

Q: What considerations have been taken for the eventual merging of query and the aggregation framework?

In the future, it is probable that a new query engine (QE) will look very much like the aggregation framework. Given
this assumption, we know that both `find` and `aggregate` will be renderable in QE, each maintaining their ordering
guarantees for full backwards compatibility.

Hence, the only real concern is how to initiate a query using QE. While `find` is preferable, it would be a backwards
breaking change. It might be decided that `find` is what should be used, and all drivers will release major revisions
with this backwards breaking change. Alternatively, it might be decided that another initiator would be used.

Q: Didn't we just build a bulk API?

Yes, most drivers did just build out a bulk API (fluent-bulk-api). While unfortunate, we felt it better to have the bulk
api be consistent with the rest of the methods in the CRUD family of operations. However, the fluent-bulk-api is still
able to be used as this change is non-backwards breaking. Any driver which implemented the fluent bulk API should
deprecate it and drivers that have not built it should not do so.

Q: Should drivers offer explain helpers?\
Originally, it was determined that explain should not be exposed via
specialized APIs in drivers because it it was deemed to be an unusual use-case for a driver. We'd like users to use the
shell for this purpose. However, explain is still possible from a driver. Some drivers have historically provided
explain helpers and continue to do so. Drivers that do not offer explain helpers can run explain commands using the
runCommand API.

Q: What about explain?

Explain has been determined to be not a normal use-case for a driver. We'd like users to use the shell for this purpose.
However, explain is still possible from a driver. For find, it can be passed as a modifier. Aggregate can be run using a
runCommand method passing the explain option. In addition, server 3.0 offers an explain command that can be run using a
runCommand method.

Q: Where did modifiers go in FindOptions?

MongoDB 3.2 introduced the find command. As opposed to using the general "modifiers" field any longer, each relevant
option is listed explicitly. Some options, such as "tailable" or "singleBatch" are not listed as they are derived from
other fields. Upgrading a driver should be a simple procedure of deprecating the "modifiers" field and introducing the
new fields. When a collision occurs, the explicitly specified field should override the value in "modifiers".

Q: Where is `save`?

Drivers have historically provided a `save` method, which was syntactic sugar for upserting or inserting a document
based on whether it contained an identifier, respectively. While the `save` method may be convenient for interactive
environments, such as the shell, it was intentionally excluded from the CRUD specification for language drivers for
several reasons. The `save` method promotes a design pattern of "fetch, modify, replace" and invites race conditions in
application logic. Additionally, the split nature of `save` makes it difficult to discern at a glance if application
code will perform an insert or potentially dangerous full-document replacement. Instead of relying on `save`,
application code should know whether document already has an identifier and explicitly call `insertOne` or `replaceOne`
with the `upsert` option.

Q: Where is `useCursor` in AggregateOptions?

Inline aggregation results are no longer supported in server 3.5.2+. The
[aggregate command](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/command/aggregate/) must be provided either the
`cursor` document or the `explain` boolean. AggregateOptions does not define an `explain` option. If a driver does
support an `explain` option, the `cursor` document should be omitted if `explain` is `true`. Otherwise a `cursor`
document must be added to the `aggregate` command. Regardless, `useCursor` is no longer needed. Removing `useCursor` is
a backwards breaking change, so drivers should first deprecate this option in a minor release, and remove it in a major
release.

Q: Where is `singleBatch` in FindOptions?

Drivers have historically allowed users to request a single batch of results (after which the cursor is closed) by
specifying a negative value for the `limit` option. For servers \< 3.2, a single batch may be requested by specifying a
negative value in the `numberToReturn` wire protocol field. For servers >= 3.2, the `find` command defines `limit` as a
non-negative integer option but introduces a `singleBatch` boolean option. Rather than introduce a `singleBatch` option
to FindOptions, the spec preserves the existing API for `limit` and instructs drivers to convert negative values
accordingly for servers >= 3.2.

Q: Why are client-side errors raised for some unsupported options?

Server versions before 3.4 were inconsistent about reporting errors for unrecognized command options and may simply
ignore them, which means a client-side error is the only way to inform users that such options are unsupported. For
unacknowledged writes using OP_MSG, a client-side error is necessary because the server has no chance to return a
response (even though a 3.6+ server is otherwise capable of reporting errors for unrecognized options). For
unacknowledged writes using legacy opcodes (i.e. OP_INSERT, OP_UPDATE, and OP_DELETE), the message body has no field
with which to express these options so a client-side error is the only mechanism to inform the user that such options
are unsupported. The spec does not explicitly refer to unacknowledged writes using OP_QUERY primarily because a response
document is always returned and drivers generally would not consider using OP_QUERY precisely for that reason.

Q: Why does reverting to using `count` instead of `aggregate` with `$collStats` for estimatedDocumentCount not require a
major version bump in the drivers, even though it might break users of the Stable API?

SemVer
[allows](https://semver.org/#what-if-i-inadvertently-alter-the-public-api-in-a-way-that-is-not-compliant-with-the-version-number-change-ie-the-code-incorrectly-introduces-a-major-breaking-change-in-a-patch-release)
for a library to include a breaking change in a minor or patch version if the change is required to fix another
accidental breaking change introduced in a prior version and is not expected to further break a large number of users.
Given that the original switch to `$collStats` was a breaking change due to it not working on views, the number of users
using estimatedDocumentCount with `apiStrict: true` is small, and the server is back-porting the addition of `count` to
the Stable API, it was decided that this change was acceptable to make in minor version releases of the drivers per the
aforementioned allowance in the SemVer spec.

In server versions 5.0 and earlier, the wire version was defined as a numeric literal in `src/mongo/db/wire_version.h <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/db/wire_version.h>`_. Since server version 5.1 (`SERVER-58346 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/SERVER-58346>`_), the wire version is derived from the number of releases since 4.0 (using `src/mongo/util/version/releases.h.tpl <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/util/version/releases.h.tpl>`_ and `src/mongo/util/version/releases.yml <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/blob/master/src/mongo/util/version/releases.yml>`_).

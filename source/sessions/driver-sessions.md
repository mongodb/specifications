# Sessions Specification

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 3.6

______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

Version 3.6 of the server introduces the concept of logical sessions for clients. A session is an abstract concept that
represents a set of sequential operations executed by an application that are related in some way. This specification is
limited to how applications start and end sessions. Other specifications define various ways in which sessions are used
(e.g. causally consistent reads, retryable writes, or transactions).

This specification also discusses how drivers participate in distributing the cluster time throughout a deployment, a
process known as "gossipping the cluster time". While gossipping the cluster time is somewhat orthogonal to sessions,
any driver that implements sessions MUST also implement gossipping the cluster time, so it is included in this
specification.

## Definitions

### META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Terms

**ClientSession**

The driver object representing a client session and the operations that can be performed on it. Depending on the
language a driver is written in this might be an interface or a class. See also `ServerSession`.

**Deployment**

A set of servers that are all part of a single MongoDB cluster. We avoid the word "cluster" because some people
interpret "cluster" to mean "sharded cluster".

**Explicit session**

A session that was started explicitly by the application by calling `startSession` and passed as an argument to an
operation.

**MongoClient**

The root object of a driver's API. MAY be named differently in some drivers.

**Implicit session**

A session that was started implicitly by the driver because the application called an operation without providing an
explicit session.

**MongoCollection**

The driver object representing a collection and the operations that can be performed on it. MAY be named differently in
some drivers.

**MongoDatabase**

The driver object representing a database and the operations that can be performed on it. MAY be named differently in
some drivers.

**ServerSession**

The driver object representing a server session. This type is an implementation detail and does not need to be public.
See also `ClientSession`.

**Server session ID**

A server session ID is a token used to identify a particular server session. A driver can ask the server for a session
ID using the `startSession` command or it can generate one locally (see Generating a Session ID locally).

**Session**

A session is an abstract concept that represents a set of sequential operations executed by an application that are
related in some way. Other specifications define the various ways in which operations can be related, but examples
include causally consistent reads and retryable writes.

**Topology**

The current configuration and state of a deployment.

**Unacknowledged writes**

Unacknowledged writes are write operations that are sent to the server without waiting for a reply acknowledging the
write. See the "When using unacknowledged writes" section below for information on how unacknowledged writes interact
with sessions.

**Network error**

Any network exception writing to or reading from a socket (e.g. a socket timeout or error).

## Specification

Drivers currently have no concept of a session. The driver API will be expanded to provide a way for applications to
start and end sessions and to execute operations in the context of a session. The goal is to expand the API in a way
that introduces no backward breaking changes. Existing applications that don't use sessions don't need to be changed,
and new applications that don't need sessions can continue to be written using the existing API.

To use sessions an application will call new (or overloaded) methods that take a session parameter.

## Naming variations

This specification defines names for new methods and types. To the extent possible, these names SHOULD be used by
drivers. However, where a driver and/or language's naming conventions differ, those naming conventions SHOULD be used.
For example, a driver might name a method `StartSession` or `start_session` instead of `startSession`, or might name a
type `client_session` instead of `ClientSession`.

## High level summary of the API changes for sessions

This section is just a high level summary of the new API. Details are provided further on.

Applications start a new session like this:

```typescript
options = new SessionOptions(/* various settings */);
session = client.startSession(options);
```

The `SessionOptions` will be individually defined in several other specifications. It is expected that the set of
`SessionOptions` will grow over time as sessions are used for new purposes.

Applications use a session by passing it as an argument to operation methods. For example:

```typescript
collection.InsertOne(session /* etc. */)
collection.UpdateOne(session /* etc. */)
```

Applications end a session like this:

```typescript
session.endSession()
```

This specification does not deal with multi-document transactions, which are covered in
[their own specification](../transactions/transactions.md).

## MongoClient changes

`MongoClient` interface summary

```java
class SessionOptions {
  // various other options as defined in other specifications
}

interface MongoClient {
  ClientSession startSession(SessionOptions options);
  // other existing members of MongoClient
}
```

Each new member is documented below.

While it is not part of the public API, `MongoClient` also needs a private (or internal) `clusterTime` member
(containing either a BSON document or null) to record the highest `clusterTime` observed in a deployment (as described
below in [Gossipping the cluster time](#gossipping-the-cluster-time)).

### startSession

The `startSession` method starts a new `ClientSession` with the provided options.

It MUST NOT be possible to change the options provided to `startSession` after `startSession` has been called. This can
be accomplished by making the `SessionOptions` class immutable or using some equivalent mechanism that is idiomatic for
your language.

It is valid to call `startSession` with no options set. This will result in a `ClientSession` that has no effect on the
operations performed in the context of that session, other than to include a session ID in commands sent to the server.

The `SessionOptions` MAY be a strongly typed class in some drivers, or MAY be a loosely typed dictionary in other
drivers. Drivers MUST define `SessionOptions` in such a way that new options can be added in a backward compatible way
(it is acceptable for backward compatibility to be at the source level).

A `ClientSession` MUST be associated with a `ServerSession` at the time `startSession` is called. As an implementation
optimization drivers MUST reuse `ServerSession` instances across multiple `ClientSession` instances subject to the rule
that a server session MUST NOT be used by two `ClientSession` instances at the same time (see the Server Session Pool
section). Additionally, a `ClientSession` may only ever be associated with one `ServerSession` for its lifetime.

Drivers MUST NOT check for session support in `startSession`. Instead, if sessions are not supported, the error MUST be
reported the first time the session is used for an operation (See
[How to Tell Whether a Connection Supports Sessions](#how-to-tell-whether-a-connection-supports-sessions)).

### Explicit vs implicit sessions

An explicit session is one started explicitly by the application by calling `startSession`. An implicit session is one
started implicitly by the driver because the application called an operation without providing an explicit session.
Internally, a driver must be able to distinguish between explicit and implicit sessions, but no public API for this is
necessary because an application will never see an implicit session.

The motivation for starting an implicit session for all methods that don't take an explicit session parameter is to make
sure that all commands that are sent to the server are tagged with a session ID. This improves the ability of an
operations team to monitor (and kill if necessary) long running operations. Tagging an operation with a session ID is
specially useful if a deployment wide operation needs to be killed.

### Authentication

When using authentication, using a session requires that only a single user be authenticated. Drivers that still support
authenticating multiple users at once MAY continue to do so, but MUST NOT allow sessions to be used under such
circumstances.

If `startSession` is called when multiple users are authenticated drivers MUST raise an error with the error message
"Cannot call startSession when multiple users are authenticated."

If a driver allows authentication to be changed on the fly (presumably few still do) the driver MUST either prevent
`ClientSession` instances from being used with a connection that doesn't have matching authentication or MUST return an
error if such use is attempted.

## ClientSession

`ClientSession` instances are not thread safe or fork safe. They can only be used by one thread or process at a time.

Drivers MUST document the thread-safety and fork-safety limitations of sessions. Drivers MUST NOT attempt to detect
simultaneous use by multiple threads or processes (see Q&A for the rationale).

ClientSession interface summary:

```java
interface ClientSession {
    MongoClient client;
    Optional<BsonDocument> clusterTime;
    SessionOptions options;
    BsonDocument sessionId;

    void advanceClusterTime(BsonDocument clusterTime);
    void endSession();
}
```

While it is not part of the public API, a `ClientSession` also has a private (or internal) reference to a
`ServerSession`.

Each member is documented below.

### client

This property returns the `MongoClient` that was used to start this `ClientSession`.

### clusterTime

This property returns the most recent cluster time seen by this session. If no operations have been executed using this
session this value will be null unless `advanceClusterTime` has been called. This value will also be null when a cluster
does not report cluster times.

When a driver is gossiping the cluster time it should send the more recent `clusterTime` of the `ClientSession` and the
`MongoClient`.

### options

This property returns the `SessionOptions` that were used to start this `ClientSession`.

### sessionId

This property returns the session ID of this session. Note that since `ServerSessions` are pooled, different
`ClientSession` instances can have the same session ID, but never at the same time.

### advanceClusterTime

This method advances the `clusterTime` for a session. If the new `clusterTime` is greater than the session's current
`clusterTime` then the session's `clusterTime` MUST be advanced to the new `clusterTime`. If the new `clusterTime` is
less than or equal to the session's current `clusterTime` then the session's `clusterTime` MUST NOT be changed.

This method MUST NOT advance the `clusterTime` in `MongoClient` because we have no way of verifying that the supplied
`clusterTime` is valid. If the `clusterTime` in `MongoClient` were set to an invalid value all future operations with
this `MongoClient` would result in the server returning an error. The `clusterTime` in `MongoClient` should only be
advanced with a `$clusterTime` received directly from a server.

### endSession

This method ends a `ClientSession`.

In languages that have idiomatic ways of disposing of resources, drivers SHOULD support that in addition to or instead
of `endSession`. For example, in the .NET driver `ClientSession` would implement `IDisposable` and the application could
choose to call `session.Dispose` or put the session in a using statement instead of calling `session.endSession`. If
your language has an idiomatic way of disposing resources you MAY choose to implement that in addition to or instead of
`endSession`, whichever is more idiomatic for your language.

A driver MUST allow multiple calls to `endSession` (or `Dispose`). All calls after the first one are ignored.

Conceptually, calling `endSession` implies ending the corresponding server session (by calling the `endSessions`
command). As an implementation detail drivers SHOULD cache server sessions for reuse (see Server Session Pool).

Once a `ClientSession` has ended, drivers MUST report an error if any operations are attempted with that
`ClientSession`.

## ServerSession

A `ServerSession` is the driver object that tracks a server session. This object is an implementation detail and does
not need to be public. Drivers may store this information however they choose; this data structure is defined here
merely to describe the operation of the server session pool.

ServerSession interface summary

```java
interface ServerSession {
  BsonDocument sessionId;
  DateTime lastUse;
}
```

### sessionId

This property returns the server session ID.

### lastUse

The driver MUST update the value of this property with the current DateTime every time the server session ID is sent to
the server. This allows the driver to track with reasonable accuracy the server's view of when a server session was last
used.

### Creating a ServerSession

When a driver needs to create a new `ServerSession` instance the only information it needs is the session ID to use for
the new session. It can either get the session ID from the server by running the `startSession` command, or it can
generate it locally.

In either case, the lastUse field of the `ServerSession` MUST be set to the current time when the `ServerSession` is
created.

### Generating a session ID locally

Running the `startSession` command to get a session ID for a new session requires a round trip to the server. As an
optimization the server allows drivers to generate new session IDs locally and to just start using them. When a server
sees a new session ID that it has never seen before it simply assumes that it is a new session.

A session ID is a `BsonDocument` that has the following form:

```typescript
interface SessionId {
  id: UUID
}
```

Where the UUID is encoded as a BSON binary value of subtype 4.

The id field of the session ID is a version 4 UUID that must comply with the format described in RFC 4122. Section 4.4
describes an algorithm for generating correctly-versioned UUIDs from a pseudo-random number generator.

If a driver is unable to generate a version 4 UUID it MAY instead run the `startSession` command and let the server
generate the session ID.

## MongoDatabase changes

All `MongoDatabase` methods that talk to the server MUST send a session ID with the command when connected to a
deployment that supports sessions so that the server can associate the operation with a session ID.

### New database methods that take an explicit session

All `MongoDatabase` methods that talk to the server SHOULD be overloaded to take an explicit session parameter. (See
[why is session an explicit parameter?](#why-is-session-an-explicit-parameter).)

When overloading methods to take a session parameter, the session parameter SHOULD be the first parameter. If
overloading is not possible for your language, it MAY be in a different position or MAY be embedded in an options
structure.

Methods that have a session parameter MUST check that the session argument is not null and was created by the same
`MongoClient` that this `MongoDatabase` came from and report an error if they do not match.

### Existing database methods that start an implicit session

When an existing `MongoDatabase` method that does not take a session is called, the driver MUST behave as if a new
`ClientSession` was started just for this one operation and ended immediately after this operation completes. The actual
implementation will likely involve calling `client.startSession`, but that is not required by this spec. Regardless,
please consult the startSession section to replicate the required steps for creating a session. The driver MUST NOT use
the session if the checked out connection does not support sessions (see
[How to Tell Whether a Connection Supports Sessions](#how-to-tell-whether-a-connection-supports-sessions)) and, in all
cases, MUST NOT consume a server session id until after the connection is checked out and session support is confirmed.

## MongoCollection changes

All `MongoCollection` methods that talk to the server MUST send a session ID with the command when connected to a
deployment that supports sessions so that the server can associate the operation with a session ID.

### New collection methods that take an explicit session

All `MongoCollection` methods that talk to the server, with the exception of `estimatedDocumentCount`, SHOULD be
overloaded to take an explicit session parameter. (See
[why is session an explicit parameter?](#why-is-session-an-explicit-parameter).)

When overloading methods to take a session parameter, the session parameter SHOULD be the first parameter. If
overloading is not possible for your language, it MAY be in a different position or MAY be embedded in an options
structure.

Methods that have a session parameter MUST check that the session argument is not null and was created by the same
`MongoClient` that this `MongoCollection` came from and report an error if they do not match.

The `estimatedDocumentCount` helper does not support an explicit session parameter. The underlying command, `count`, is
not supported in a transaction, so supporting an explicit session would likely confuse application developers. The
helper returns an estimate of the documents in a collection and causal consistency is unlikely to improve the accuracy
of the estimate.

### Existing collection methods that start an implicit session

When an existing `MongoCollection` method that does not take a session is called, the driver MUST behave as if a new
`ClientSession` was started just for this one operation and ended immediately after this operation completes. The actual
implementation will likely involve calling `client.startSession`, but that is not required by this spec. Regardless,
please consult the startSession section to replicate the required steps for creating a session. The driver MUST NOT use
the session if the checked out connection does not support sessions (see
[How to Tell Whether a Connection Supports Sessions](#how-to-tell-whether-a-connection-supports-sessions)) and, in all
cases, MUST NOT consume a server session id until after the connection is checked out and session support is confirmed.

## Sessions and Cursors

When an operation using a session returns a cursor, all subsequent `GETMORE` commands for that cursor MUST be run using
the same session ID.

If a driver decides to run a `KILLCURSORS` command on the cursor, it also MAY be run using the same session ID. See the
Exceptions below for when it is permissible to not include a session ID in a `KILLCURSORS` command.

## Sessions and Connections

To reduce the number of `ServerSessions` created, the driver MUST only obtain an implicit session's `ServerSession`
after it successfully checks out a connection. A driver SHOULD NOT attempt to release the acquired session before
connection check in.

Explicit sessions MAY be changed to allocate a server session similarly.

## How to Tell Whether a Connection Supports Sessions

A driver can determine whether a connection supports sessions by checking whether the `logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes`
property of the establishing handshake response has a value or not. If it has a value, sessions are supported.

In the case of an explicit session, if sessions are not supported, the driver MUST raise an error. In the case of an
implicit session, if sessions are not supported, the driver MUST ignore the session.

### Possible race condition when checking for session support

There is a possible race condition that can happen between the time the driver checks whether sessions are supported and
subsequently sends a command to the server:

- The server might have supported sessions at the time the connection was first opened (and reported a value for
  logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes in the initial response to the [handshake](../mongodb-handshake/handshake.md)), but have
  subsequently been downgraded to not support sessions. The server does not close the socket in this scenario, so the
  driver will conclude that the server at the other end of this connection supports sessions.

There is nothing that the driver can do about this race condition, and the server will just return an error in this
scenario.

## Sending the session ID to the server on all commands

When connected to a server that supports sessions a driver MUST append the session ID to every command it sends to the
server (with the exceptions noted in the following section). It does this by adding a top level `lsid` field to the
command sent to the server. A driver MUST do this without modifying any data supplied by the application (e.g. the
command document passed to runCommand).:

```typescript
interface ExampleCommandWithLSID {
  foo: 1;
  lsid: SessionId;
}
```

## Exceptions to sending the session ID to the server on all commands

There are some exceptions to the rule that a driver MUST append the session ID to every command it sends to the server.

### When opening and authenticating a connection

A driver MUST NOT append a session ID to any command sent during the process of opening and authenticating a connection.

### When monitoring the state of a deployment

A driver MAY omit a session ID in hello and legacy hello commands sent solely for the purposes of monitoring the state
of a deployment.

### When sending a parallelCollectionScan command

Sessions are designed for sequential operations and `parallelCollectionScan` is designed for parallel operation. Because
these are fundamentally incompatible goals, drivers MUST NOT append session ID to the `parallelCollectionScan` command
so that the resulting cursors have no associated session ID and thus can be used in parallel.

### When sending a killCursors command

A driver MAY omit a session ID in `killCursors` commands for two reasons. First, `killCursors` is only ever sent to a
particular server, so operation teams wouldn't need the `lsid` for cluster-wide killOp. An admin can manually kill the
op with its operation id in the case that it is slow. Secondly, some drivers have a background cursor reaper to kill
cursors that aren't exhausted and closed. Due to GC semantics, it can't use the same `lsid` for `killCursors` as was
used for a cursor's `find` and `getMore`, so there's no point in using any `lsid` at all.

### When multiple users are authenticated and the session is implicit

The driver MUST NOT send a session ID from an implicit session when multiple users are authenticated. If possible the
driver MUST NOT start an implicit session when multiple users are authenticated. Alternatively, if the driver cannot
determine whether multiple users are authenticated at the point in time that an implicit session is started, then the
driver MUST ignore any implicit sessions that subsequently end up being used on a connection that has multiple users
authenticated.

### When using unacknowledged writes

A session ID MUST NOT be used simultaneously by more than one operation. Since drivers don't wait for a response for an
unacknowledged write a driver would not know when the session ID could be reused. In theory a driver could use a new
session ID for each unacknowledged write, but that would result in many orphaned sessions building up at the server.

Therefore drivers MUST NOT send a session ID with unacknowledged writes under any circumstances:

- For unacknowledged writes with an explicit session, drivers SHOULD raise an error. If a driver allows users to provide
  an explicit session with an unacknowledged write (e.g. for backwards compatibility), the driver MUST NOT send the
  session ID.
- For unacknowledged writes without an explicit session, drivers SHOULD NOT use an implicit session. If a driver creates
  an implicit session for unacknowledged writes without an explicit session, the driver MUST NOT send the session ID.

Drivers MUST document the behavior of unacknowledged writes for both explicit and implicit sessions.

### When wrapping commands in a `$query` field

If the driver is wrapping the command in a `$query` field for non-OP_MSG messages in order to pass a readPreference to a
mongos (see
[ReadPreference and Mongos](../find_getmore_killcursors_commands/find_getmore_killcursors_commands.md#readpreference-and-mongos)),
the driver SHOULD NOT add the `lsid` as a top-level field, and MUST add the `lsid` as a field of the `$query`

```typescript
// Wrapped command:
interface WrappedCommandExample {
  $query: {
    find: { foo: 1 }
  },
  $readPreference: {}
}

// Correct application of lsid
interface CorrectLSIDUsageExample {
  $query: {
    find: { foo: 1 },
    lsid: SessionId
  },
  $readPreference: {}
}

// Incorrect application of lsid
interface IncorrectLSIDUsageExample {
  $query: {
    find: { foo: 1 }
  },
  $readPreference: {},
  lsid: SessionId
}
```

## Server Commands

### startSession

The `startSession` server command has the following format:

```typescript
interface StartSessionCommand {
  startSession: 1;
  $clusterTime?: ClusterTime;
}
```

The `$clusterTime` field should only be sent when gossipping the cluster time. See the section "Gossipping the cluster
time" for information on `$clusterTime`.

The `startSession` command MUST be sent to the `admin` database.

The server response has the following format:

```typescript
interface StartSessionResponse {
  ok: 1;
  id: BsonDocument;
}
```

In case of an error, the server response has the following format:

```typescript
interface StartSessionError {
  ok: 0;
  errmsg: string;
  code: number;
}
```

When connected to a replica set the `startSession` command MUST be sent to the primary if the primary is available. The
`startSession` command MAY be sent to a secondary if there is no primary available at the time the `startSession`
command needs to be run.

Drivers SHOULD generate session IDs locally if possible instead of running the `startSession` command, since running the
command requires a network round trip.

### endSessions

The `endSessions` server command has the following format:

```typescript
interface EndSessionCommand {
  endSessions: Array<SessionId>;
  $clusterTime?: ClusterTime;
}
```

The `$clusterTime` field should only be sent when gossipping the cluster time. See the section of "Gossipping the
cluster time" for information on `$clusterTime`.

The `endSessions` command MUST be sent to the `admin` database.

The server response has the following format:

```typescript
interface EndSessionResponse {
  ok: 1;
}
```

In case of an error, the server response has the following format:

```typescript
interface EndSessionError {
  ok: 0;
  errmsg: string;
  code: number;
}
```

Drivers MUST ignore any errors returned by the `endSessions` command.

The `endSessions` command MUST be run once when the `MongoClient` instance is shut down. If the number of sessions is
very large the `endSessions` command SHOULD be run multiple times to end 10,000 sessions at a time (in order to avoid
creating excessively large commands).

When connected to a sharded cluster the `endSessions` command can be sent to any mongos. When connected to a replica set
the `endSessions` command MUST be sent to the primary if the primary is available, otherwise it MUST be sent to any
available secondary.

## Server Session Pool

Conceptually, each `ClientSession` can be thought of as having a new corresponding `ServerSession`. However, starting a
server session might require a round trip to the server (which can be avoided by generating the session ID locally) and
ending a session requires a separate round trip to the server. Drivers can operate more efficiently and put less load on
the server if they cache `ServerSession` instances for reuse. To this end drivers MUST implement a server session pool
containing `ServerSession` instances available for reuse. A `ServerSession` pool MUST belong to a `MongoClient` instance
and have the same lifetime as the `MongoClient` instance.

When a new implicit `ClientSession` is started it MUST NOT attempt to acquire a server session from the server session
pool immediately. When a new explicit `ClientSession` is started it MAY attempt to acquire a server session from the
server session pool immediately. See the algorithm below for the steps to follow when attempting to acquire a
`ServerSession` from the server session pool.

Note that `ServerSession` instances acquired from the server session pool might have as little as one minute left before
becoming stale and being discarded server side. Drivers MUST document that if an application waits more than one minute
after calling `startSession` to perform operations with that session it risks getting errors due to the server session
going stale before it was used.

A server session is considered stale by the server when it has not been used for a certain amount of time. The default
amount of time is 30 minutes, but this value is configurable on the server. Servers that support sessions will report
this value in the `logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes` field of the reply to the hello and legacy hello commands. The smallest
reported timeout is recorded in the `logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes` property of the `TopologyDescription`. See the Server
Discovery And Monitoring specification for details.

When a `ClientSession` is ended it MUST return the server session to the server session pool. See the algorithm below
for the steps to follow when returning a `ServerSession` instance to the server session pool.

The server session pool has no maximum size. The pool only shrinks when a server session is acquired for use or
discarded.

When a `MongoClient` instance is closed the driver MUST proactively inform the server that the pooled server sessions
will no longer be used by sending one or more `endSessions` commands to the server.

The server session pool is modeled as a double ended queue. The algorithms below require the ability to add and remove
`ServerSession` instances from the front of the queue and to inspect and possibly remove `ServerSession` instances from
the back of the queue. The front of the queue holds `ServerSession` instances that have been released recently and
should be the first to be reused. The back of the queue holds `ServerSession` instances that have not been used recently
and that potentially will be discarded if they are not used again before they expire.

An implicit session MUST be returned to the pool immediately following the completion of an operation. When an implicit
session is associated with a cursor for use with `getMore` operations, the session MUST be returned to the pool
immediately following a `getMore` operation that indicates that the cursor has been exhausted. In particular, it MUST
not wait until all documents have been iterated by the application or until the application disposes of the cursor. For
language runtimes that provide the ability to attach finalizers to objects that are run prior to garbage collection, the
cursor class SHOULD return an implicit session to the pool in the finalizer if the cursor has not already been
exhausted.

If a driver supports process forking, the session pool needs to be cleared on one side of the forked processes (just
like sockets need to reconnect). Drivers MUST provide a way to clear the session pool without sending `endSessions`.
Drivers MAY make this automatic when the process ID changes. If they do not, they MUST document how to clear the session
pool wherever they document fork support. After clearing the session pool in this way, drivers MUST ensure that sessions
already checked out are not returned to the new pool.

If a driver has a server session pool and a network error is encountered when executing any command with a
`ClientSession`, the driver MUST mark the associated `ServerSession` as dirty. Dirty server sessions are discarded when
returned to the server session pool. It is valid for a dirty session to be used for subsequent commands (e.g. an
implicit retry attempt, a later command in a bulk write, or a later operation on an explicit session), however, it MUST
remain dirty for the remainder of its lifetime regardless if later commands succeed.

### Algorithm to acquire a ServerSession instance from the server session pool

1. If the server session pool is empty create a new `ServerSession` and use it
2. Otherwise remove a `ServerSession` from the front of the queue and examine it:
   - If the driver is in load balancer mode, use this `ServerSession`.
   - If it has at least one minute left before becoming stale use this `ServerSession`
   - If it has less than one minute left before becoming stale discard it (let it be garbage collected) and return to
     step 1.

See the [Load Balancer Specification](../load-balancers/load-balancers.md#session-expiration) for details on session
expiration.

### Algorithm to return a ServerSession instance to the server session pool

1. Before returning a server session to the pool a driver MUST first check the server session pool for server sessions
   at the back of the queue that are about to expire (meaning they will expire in less than one minute). A driver MUST
   stop checking server sessions once it encounters a server session that is not about to expire. Any server sessions
   found that are about to expire are removed from the end of the queue and discarded (or allowed to be garbage
   collected)
2. Then examine the server session that is being returned to the pool and:
   - If this session is marked dirty (i.e. it was involved in a network error) discard it (let it be garbage collected)
   - If it will expire in less than one minute discard it (let it be garbage collected)
   - If it won't expire for at least one minute add it to the front of the queue

## Gossipping the cluster time

Drivers MUST gossip the cluster time when connected to a deployment that uses cluster times.

Gossipping the cluster time is a process in which the driver participates in distributing the logical cluster time in a
deployment. Drivers learn the current cluster time (from a particular server's perspective) in responses they receive
from servers. Drivers in turn forward the highest cluster time they have seen so far to any server they subsequently
send commands to.

A driver detects that it MUST participate in gossipping the cluster time when it sees a `$clusterTime` in a response
received from a server.

### Receiving the current cluster time

Drivers MUST examine all responses from the server commands to see if they contain a top level field named
`$clusterTime` formatted as follows:

```typescript
interface ClusterTime {
  clusterTime: Timestamp;
  signature: {
    hash: Binary;
    keyId: Int64;
  };

```

Whenever a driver receives a cluster time from a server it MUST compare it to the current highest seen cluster time for
the deployment. If the new cluster time is higher than the highest seen cluster time it MUST become the new highest seen
cluster time. Two cluster times are compared using only the BsonTimestamp value of the `clusterTime` embedded field (be
sure to include both the timestamp and the increment of the BsonTimestamp in the comparison). The signature field does
not participate in the comparison.

### Sending the highest seen cluster time

Whenever a driver sends a command to a server it MUST include the highest seen cluster time in a top level field called
`$clusterTime`, in the same format as it was received in (but see Gossipping with mixed server versions below).

### How to compute the `$clusterTime` to send to a server

When sending `$clusterTime` to the server the driver MUST send the greater of the `clusterTime` values from
`MongoClient` and `ClientSession`. Normally a session's `clusterTime` will be less than or equal to the `clusterTime` in
`MongoClient`, but it could be greater than the `clusterTime` in `MongoClient` if `advanceClusterTime` was called with a
`clusterTime` that came from somewhere else.

A driver MUST NOT use the `clusterTime` of a `ClientSession` anywhere else except when executing an operation with this
session. This rule protects the driver from the scenario where `advanceClusterTime` was called with an invalid
`clusterTime` by limiting the resulting server errors to the one session. The `clusterTime` of a `MongoClient` MUST NOT
be advanced by any `clusterTime` other than a `$clusterTime` received directly from a server.

The safe way to compute the `$clusterTime` to send to a server is:

1. When the `ClientSession` is first started its `clusterTime` is set to null.

2. When the driver sends `$clusterTime` to the server it should send the greater of the `ClientSession` `clusterTime`
   and the `MongoClient` `clusterTime` (either one could be null).

3. When the driver receives a `$clusterTime` from the server it should advance both the `ClientSession` and the
   `MongoClient` `clusterTime`. The `clusterTime` of a `ClientSession` can also be advanced by calling
   `advanceClusterTime`.

This sequence ensures that if the `clusterTime` of a `ClientSession` is invalid only that one session will be affected.
The `MongoClient` `clusterTime` is only updated with `$clusterTime` values known to be valid because they were received
directly from a server.

### Tracking the highest seen cluster time does not require checking the deployment topology or the server version

Drivers do not need to check the deployment topology or the server version they are connected to in order to track the
highest seen `$clusterTime`. They simply need to check for the presence of the `$clusterTime` field in responses
received from servers.

### Gossipping with mixed server versions

Drivers MUST check that the server they are sending a command to supports `$clusterTime` before adding `$clusterTime` to
the command. A server supports `$clusterTime` when the `maxWireVersion` >= 6.

This supports the (presumably short lived) scenario where not all servers have been upgraded to 3.6.

## Test Plan

See the [README](tests/README.md) for tests.

## Motivation

Drivers currently have no concept of a session. The driver API needs to be extended to support sessions.

## Design Rationale

The goal is to modify the driver API in such a way that existing programs that don't use sessions continue to compile
and run correctly. This goal is met by defining new methods (or overloads) that take a session parameter. An application
does not need to be modified unless it wants to take advantage of the new features supported by sessions.

## Backwards Compatibility

The API changes to support sessions extend the existing API but do not introduce any backward breaking changes. Existing
programs that don't use sessions continue to compile and run correctly.

## Reference Implementation (always required)

A reference implementation must be completed before any spec is given status "Final", but it need not be completed
before the spec is "Accepted". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and
rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to
resolving many discussions of spec details. A final reference implementation must include test code and documentation.

The C and C# drivers will do initial POC implementations.

## Future work (optional)

Use this section to discuss any possible work for a future spec. This could cover issues where no consensus could be
reached but that don't block this spec, changes that were rejected due to unclear use cases, etc.

## Open questions

## Q&A

### Why do we say drivers MUST NOT attempt to detect unsafe multi-threaded or multi-process use of `ClientSession`?

Because doing so would provide an illusion of safety. It doesn't make these instances thread safe. And even if when
testing an application no such exceptions are encountered, that doesn't prove anything. The application might still be
using the instances in a thread-unsafe way and just didn't happen to do so during a test run. The final argument is that
checking this would require overhead that doesn't provide any clear benefit.

### Why is session an explicit parameter?

A previous draft proposed that ClientSession would be a MongoClient-like object added to the object hierarchy:

```javascript
session = client.startSession(...)
database = session.getDatabase(...) // database is associated with session
collection = database.getCollection(...) // collection is associated with session
// operations on collection implicitly use session
collection.insertOne({})
session.endSession()
```

The central feature of this design is that a MongoCollection (or database, or perhaps a GridFS object) is associated
with a session, which is then an implied parameter to any operations executed using that MongoCollection.

This API was rejected, with the justification that a ClientSession does not naturally belong to the state of a
MongoCollection. MongoCollection has up to now been a stable long-lived object that could be widely shared, and in most
drivers it is thread safe. Once we associate a ClientSession with it, the MongoCollection object becomes short-lived and
is no longer thread safe. It is a bad sign that MongoCollection's thread safety and lifetime vary depending on how its
parent MongoDatabase is created.

Instead, we require users to pass session as a parameter to each function:

```javascript
session = client.startSession(...)
database = client.getDatabase(...)
collection = database.getCollection(...)
// users must explicitly pass session to operations
collection.insertOne(session, {})
session.endSession()
```

### Why does a network error cause the `ServerSession` to be discarded from the pool?

When a network error is encountered when executing an operation with a `ClientSession`, the operation may be left
running on the server. Re-using this `ServerSession` can lead to parallel operations which violates the rule that a
session must be used sequentially. This results in multiple problems:

1. killSessions to end an earlier operation would surprisingly also end a later operation.
2. An otherwise unrelated operation that just happens to use that same server session will potentially block waiting for
   the previous operation to complete. For example, a transactional write will block a subsequent transactional write.

### Why do automatic retry attempts re-use a dirty implicit session?

The retryable writes spec requires that both the original and retry attempt use the same server session. The server will
block the retry attempt until the initial attempt completes at which point the retry attempt will continue executing.

For retryable reads that use an implicit session, drivers could choose to use a new server session for the retry attempt
however this would lose the information that these two reads are related.

### Why don't drivers run the endSessions command to cleanup dirty server sessions?

Drivers do not run the endSessions command when discarding a dirty server session because disconnects should be
relatively rare and the server won't normally accumulate a large number of abandoned dirty sessions. Any abandoned
sessions will be automatically cleaned up by the server after the configured `logicalSessionTimeoutMinutes`.

### Why must drivers wait to consume a server session until after a connection is checked out?

The problem that may occur is when the number of concurrent application requests are larger than the number of available
connections, the driver may generate many more implicit sessions than connections. For example with maxPoolSize=1 and
100 threads, 100 implicit sessions may be created. This increases the load on the server since session state is cached
in memory. In the worst case this kind of workload can hit the session limit and trigger TooManyLogicalSessions.

In order to address this, drivers MUST NOT consume a server session id until after the connection is checked out. This
change will limit the number of "in use" server sessions to no greater than an application's maxPoolSize.

The language here is specific about obtaining a server session as opposed to creating the implicit session to permit
drivers to take an implementation approach where the implicit session creation logic largely remains unchanged. Implicit
session creation can be left as is, as long as the underlying server resource isn't allocated until it is needed and,
known it will be used, after connection checkout succeeds.

It is still possible that via explicit sessions or cursors, which hold on to the session they started with, a driver
could over allocate sessions. But those scenarios are extenuating and outside the scope of solving in this spec.

### Why should drivers NOT attempt to release a serverSession before checking back in the operation's connection?

There are a variety of cases, such as retryable operations or cursor creating operations, where a `serverSession` must
remain acquired by the `ClientSession` after an operation is attempted. Attempting to account for all these scenarios
has risks that do not justify the potential guaranteed `ServerSession` allocation limiting.

Notes
=====

This directory contains tests for the Versioned API specification. They are
implemented in the `Unified Test Format <../../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.rst>`__,
and require schema version 1.1. Note that to run these tests, the server must be
started with both ``enableTestCommands`` and ``acceptAPIVersion2`` parameters
set to true.

## Abstract

DBRefs are a convention for expressing a reference to another document as an embedded document (i.e. BSON type 0x03).
Several drivers provide a model class for encoding and/or decoding DBRef documents. This specification will both define
the structure of a DBRef and provide guidance for implementing model classes in drivers that choose to do so.

## META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

This specification presents documents as Extended JSON for readability and expressing special types (e.g. ObjectId).
Although JSON fields are unordered, the order of fields presented herein should be considered pertinent. This is
especially relevant for the [Test Plan](#test-plan).

## Specification

### DBRef Structure

A DBRef is an embedded document with the following fields:

- `$ref`: required string field. Contains the name of the collection where the referenced document resides. This MUST be
  the first field in the DBRef.
- `$id`: required field. Contains the value of the `_id` field of the referenced document. This MUST be the second field
  in the DBRef.
- `$db`: optional string field. Contains the name of the database where the referenced document resides. If specified,
  this MUST be the third field in the DBRef. If omitted, the referenced document is assumed to reside in the same
  database as the DBRef.
- Extra, optional fields may follow after `$id` or `$db` (if specified). There are no inherent restrictions on extra
  field names; however, older server versions may impose their own restrictions (e.g. no dots or dollars).

DBRefs have no relation to the deprecated DBPointer BSON type (i.e. type 0x0C).

#### Examples of Valid DBRefs

The following examples are all valid DBRefs:

```typescript
// Basic DBRef with only $ref and $id fields
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": { "$oid": "60a6fe9a54f4180c86309efa" } }

// DBRef $id is not necessarily an ObjectId
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1 }

// DBRef with optional $db field
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0" }

// DBRef with extra, optional fields (with or without $db)
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0", "foo": "bar" }
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "foo": true }

// Extra field names have no inherent restrictions
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$foo": "bar" }
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "foo.bar": 0 }
```

#### Examples of Invalid DBRefs

The following examples are all invalid DBRefs:

```typescript
// Required fields are omitted
{ "$ref": "coll0" }
{ "$id": { "$oid": "60a6fe9a54f4180c86309efa" } }

// Invalid types for $ref or $db
{ "$ref": true, "$id": 1 }
{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": 1 }

// Fields are out of order
{ "$id": 1, "$ref": "coll0" }
```

### Implementing a DBRef Model

Drivers MAY provide a model class for encoding and/or decoding DBRef documents. For those drivers that do, this section
defines expected behavior of that class. This section does not prohibit drivers from implementing additional
functionality, provided it does not conflict with any of these guidelines.

#### Constructing a DBRef model

Drivers MAY provide an API for constructing a DBRef model directly from its constituent parts. If so:

- Drivers MUST solicit a string value for `$ref`.
- Drivers MUST solicit an arbitrary value for `$id`. Drivers SHOULD NOT enforce any restrictions on this value; however,
  this may be necessary if the driver is unable to differentiate between certain BSON types (e.g. `null`, `undefined`)
  and the parameter being unspecified.
- Drivers SHOULD solicit an optional string value for `$db`.
- Drivers MUST require `$ref` and `$db` (if specified) to be strings but MUST NOT enforce any
  [naming restrictions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions) on the string values.
- Drivers MAY solicit extra, optional fields.

#### Decoding a BSON document to a DBRef model

Drivers MAY support explicit and/or implicit decoding. An example of explicit decoding might be a DBRef model
constructor that takes a BSON document. An example of implicit decoding might be configuring the driver's BSON codec to
automatically convert embedded documents that comply with the [DBRef Structure](#dbref-structure) into a DBRef model.

Drivers that provide implicit decoding SHOULD provide some way for applications to opt out and allow DBRefs to be
decoded like any other embedded document.

When decoding a BSON document to a DBRef model:

- Drivers MUST require `$ref` and `$id` to be present.
- Drivers MUST require `$ref` and `$db` (if present) to be strings but MUST NOT enforce any
  [naming restrictions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/limits/#naming-restrictions) on the string values.
- Drivers MUST accept any BSON type for `$id` and MUST NOT enforce any restrictions on its value.
- Drivers MUST preserve extra, optional fields (beyond `$ref`, `$id`, and `$db`) and MUST provide some way to access
  those fields via the DBRef model. For example, an accessor method that returns the original BSON document (including
  `$ref`, etc.) would fulfill this requirement.

If a BSON document cannot be implicitly decoded to a DBRef model, it MUST be left as-is (like any other embedded
document). If a BSON document cannot be explicitly decoded to a DBRef model, the driver MUST raise an error.

Since DBRefs are a special type of embedded document, a DBRef model class used for decoding SHOULD inherit the class
used to represent an embedded document (e.g. Hash in Ruby). This will allow applications to always expect an instance of
a common class when decoding an embedded document (if desired) and should also support the requirement for DBRef models
to provide access to any extra, optional fields.

#### Encoding a DBRef model to a BSON document

Drivers MAY support explicit and/or implicit encoding. An example of explicit encoding might be a DBRef method that
returns its corresponding representation as a BSON document. An example of implicit encoding might be configuring the
driver's BSON codec to automatically convert DBRef models to the corresponding BSON document representation as needed.

If a driver supports implicit decoding of BSON to a DBRef model, it SHOULD also support implicit encoding. Doing so will
allow applications to more easily round-trip DBRefs through the driver.

When encoding a DBRef model to BSON document:

- Drivers MUST encode all fields in the order defined in [DBRef Structure](#dbref-structure).
- Drivers MUST encode `$ref` and `$id`. If `$db` was specified, it MUST be encoded after `$id`. If any extra, optional
  fields were specified, they MUST be encoded after `$id` or `$db`.
- If the DBRef includes any extra, optional fields after `$id` or `$db`, drivers SHOULD attempt to preserve the original
  order of those fields relative to one another.

## Test Plan

The test plan consists of a series of prose tests. These tests are only relevant to drivers that provide a DBRef model
class.

The documents in these tests are presented as Extended JSON for readability; however, readers should consider the field
order pertinent when translating to BSON (or their language equivalent). These tests are not intended to exercise a
driver's Extended JSON parser. Implementations SHOULD construct the documents directly using native BSON types (e.g.
Document, ObjectId).

### Decoding

These tests are only relevant to drivers that allow decoding into a DBRef model. Drivers SHOULD implement these tests
for both explicit and implicit decoding code paths as needed.

1. Valid documents MUST be decoded to a DBRef model. For each of the following:

   1. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": { "$oid": "60a6fe9a54f4180c86309efa" } }`
   2. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1 }`
   3. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": null }`
   4. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0" }`

   Assert that each document is successfully decoded to a DBRef model. Assert that the `$ref`, `$id`, and `$db` (if
   applicable) fields have their expected value.

2. Valid documents with extra fields MUST be decoded to a DBRef model and the model MUST provide some way to access
   those extra fields. For each of the following:

   1. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0", "foo": "bar" }`
   2. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "foo": true, "bar": false }`
   3. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "meta": { "foo": 1, "bar": 2 } }`
   4. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$foo": "bar" }`
   5. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "foo.bar": 0 }`

   Assert that each document is successfully decoded to a DBRef model. Assert that the `$ref`, `$id`, and `$db` (if
   applicable) fields have their expected value. Assert that it is possible to access all extra fields and that those
   fields have their expected value.

3. Documents with out of order fields that are otherwise valid MUST be decoded to a DBRef model. For each of the
   following:

   1. `{ "$id": 1, "$ref": "coll0" }`
   2. `{ "$db": "db0", "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1 }`
   3. `{ "foo": 1, "$id": 1, "$ref": "coll0" }`
   4. `{ "foo": 1, "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0" }`
   5. `{ "foo": 1, "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0", "bar": 1 }`

   Assert that each document is successfully decoded to a DBRef model. Assert that the `$ref`, `$id`, `$db` (if
   applicable), and any extra fields (if applicable) have their expected value.

4. Documents missing required fields MUST NOT be decoded to a DBRef model. For each of the following:

   1. `{ "$ref": "coll0" }`
   2. `{ "$id": { "$oid": "60a6fe9a54f4180c86309efa" } }`
   3. `{ "$db": "db0" }`

   Assert that each document is not decoded to a DBRef model. In the context of implicit decoding, the document MUST be
   decoded like any other embedded document. In the context of explicit decoding, the DBRef decoding method MUST raise
   an error.

5. Documents with invalid types for `$ref` or `$db` MUST NOT be decoded to a DBRef model. For each of the following:

   1. `{ "$ref": true, "$id": 1 }`
   2. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": 1 }`

   Assert that each document is not decoded to a DBRef model. In the context of implicit decoding, the document MUST be
   decoded like any other embedded document. In the context of explicit decoding, the DBRef decoding method MUST raise
   an error.

### Encoding

These tests are only relevant to drivers that allow encoding a DBRef model. Drivers SHOULD implement these tests for
both explicit and implicit encoding code paths as needed.

Drivers MAY use any method to create the DBRef model for each test (e.g. constructor, explicit decoding method).

Drivers MAY skip tests that cannot be implemented as written (e.g. DBRef model constructor does not support extra,
optional fields and the driver also does not support explicit/implicit decoding).

1. Encoding DBRefs with basic fields. For each of the following:

   1. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": { "$oid": "60a6fe9a54f4180c86309efa" } }`
   2. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1 }`
   3. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": null }`
   4. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0" }`

   Assert that each DBRef model is successfully encoded to a BSON document. Assert that the `$ref`, `$id`, and `$db` (if
   applicable) fields appear in the correct order and have their expected values.

2. Encoding DBRefs with extra, optional fields. For each of the following:

   1. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0", "foo": "bar" }`
   2. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "foo": true, "bar": false }`
   3. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "meta": { "foo": 1, "bar": 2 } }`
   4. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$foo": "bar" }`
   5. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "foo.bar": 0 }`

   Assert that each DBRef model is successfully encoded to a BSON document. Assert that the `$ref`, `$id`, `$db` (if
   applicable), and any extra fields appear in the correct order and have their expected values.

3. Encoding DBRefs re-orders any out of order fields during decoding. This test MUST NOT use a constructor that solicits
   fields individually. For each of the following:

   1. `{ "$id": 1, "$ref": "coll0" }`
   2. `{ "$db": "db0", "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1 }`
   3. `{ "foo": 1, "$id": 1, "$ref": "coll0" }`
   4. `{ "foo": 1, "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0" }`
   5. `{ "foo": 1, "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0", "bar": 1 }`

   Assert that each document is successfully decoded to a DBRef model and then successfully encoded back to a BSON
   document. Assert that the order of fields in each encoded BSON document matches the following, respectively:

   1. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1 }`
   2. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0" }`
   3. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "foo": 1 }`
   4. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0", "foo": 1}`
   5. `{ "$ref": "coll0", "$id": 1, "$db": "db0", "foo": 1, "bar": 1 }`

## Design Rationale

In contrast to always encoding DBRefs with the correct field order, decoding permits fields to be out of order (provided
the document is otherwise valid). This follows the
[robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) in having the driver be liberal in what it
accepts and conservative in what it emits. This does mean that round-tripping an out of order DBRef through a driver
could result in its field order being changed; however, this behavior is consistent with existing behavior in drivers
that model DBRefs (e.g. C#, Java, Node, Python, Ruby) and applications can opt out of implicit decoding if desired.

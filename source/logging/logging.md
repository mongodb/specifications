______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

This specification defines requirements for drivers' logging configuration and behavior.

## META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Specification

### Terms

**Structured logging**

Structured logging refers to producing log messages in a structured format, i.e. a series of key-value pairs, which can
be converted to external formats such as JSON.

**Unstructured logging**

Unstructured logging refers to producing string log messages which embed all attached information within that string.

### Implementation requirements

Drivers SHOULD implement support for logging in a manner that is idiomatic for their language and ecosystem.

#### Minimizing Required Code Changes

If possible, drivers SHOULD support the following configuration requirements in a manner that does not require any
changes to an application's source code, and in the case of compiled languages, does not require recompilation. However,
if that is impossible to do without conflicting with idiomatic logging patterns for the language ecosystem, it is
acceptable for a driver to require minimal changes to enable logging, such as recompiling with a feature flag specified,
or passing a logging configuration to a `MongoClient` constructor. In that case, drivers SHOULD strive to minimize the
amount of code change needed.

Drivers SHOULD take advantage of built-in support for logging configuration within logging frameworks or their language
ecosystem if available. If unavailable, drivers MUST support configuration via the listed fallback implementation
methods.

In addition to supporting configuration without code changes/recompilation, drivers MAY additionally provide support for
enabling and configuring logging via their API in a manner that does require code changes, and MAY support additional
configuration options beyond those defined in this specification.

For languages/ecosystems where libraries depend on only a logging interface (for example, the Java driver and
[SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/)) and application developers must choose a log handler, the requirements MAY be
considered satisfied if there is a log handler available in the ecosystem which users can select that satisfies the
requirements. Similarly, the requirements MAY be considered satisfied if the driver provides an integration with a
logging framework which satisfies the requirements.

#### Per-Component Configuration of Log Levels

Drivers MUST support enabling logging and specifying the minimum severity level for emitted messages on a per-component
level, for each component defined below in the [Components](#components) section.

> **Fallback implementation method**: Support configuration via environment variables corresponding to each component,
> as defined in [Components](#components), as well as via the environment variable `MONGODB_LOG_ALL`.
>
> Each of these variables may be set to any of the values defined below in [Log Severity Levels](#log-severity-levels)
> to indicate the minimum severity level at which messages should be emitted for the corresponding component, or in the
> case of `MONGODB_LOG_ALL`, all components. Setting a value for `MONGODB_LOG_ALL` is equivalent to setting that value
> for all of the per-component variables.
>
> If `MONGODB_LOG_ALL` is specified in addition to one or more component variables, the component variable(s) MUST take
> precedence.
>
> The default is to not log anything.
>
> If a variable is set to an invalid value, it MUST be treated as if it were not specified at all, and the driver MAY
> attempt to warn the user about the misconfiguration via a log message or otherwise but MUST NOT throw an exception.

#### Configurable Log Destination

Drivers MUST support configuring where log messages should be output, including the options:

- stdout

- stderr

- Output file (path MUST be configurable). For languages that are not relying on a logging interface or framework to
  handle file support, the driver can choose to either support this directly (i.e. the driver allows the user to specify
  a path and itself handles writing to that path), or to instead provide a straightforward, idiomatic way to
  programmatically consume the messages and in turn write them to a file, e.g. via a Node.js
  [stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html), along with a documentation example of how to do this.

  > **Fallback implementation method**: If the environment variable `MONGODB_LOG_PATH` is provided:
  >
  > - If the value is "stdout" (case-insensitive), log to stdout.
  > - If the value is "stderr" (case-insensitive), log to stderr.
  > - Else, if direct logging to files is supported, log to a file at the specified path. If the file already exists, it
  >   MUST be appended to.
  >
  > If the variable is not provided or is set to an invalid value (which could be invalid for any reason, e.g. the path
  > does not exist or is not writeable), the driver MUST log to stderr and the driver MAY attempt to warn the user about
  > the misconfiguration via a log message or otherwise but MUST NOT throw an exception.

#### Configurable Max Document Length

Drivers MUST support configuring the maximum logged length for extended JSON documents in log messages. The unit here is
flexible and can be bytes, Unicode code points, code units, or graphemes, depending on what a driver is able to
accomplish with its language's string APIs. The default max length is 1000 of whichever unit is selected. If the chosen
unit is anything other than a Unicode code point, the driver MUST ensure that it gracefully handles cases where the
truncation length falls mid code point, by either rounding the length up or down to the closest code point boundary or
using the Unicode replacement character, to avoid producing invalid Unicode data. Drivers MUST implement truncation
naively by simply truncating the output at the required length; i.e. do not attempt to implement truncation such that
the output is still valid JSON. Truncated extended JSON MUST have a trailing ellipsis `...` appended to indicate to the
user that truncation occurred. The ellipsis MUST NOT count toward the max length.

> **Fallback Implementation method**: Environment variable `MONGOB_LOG_MAX_DOCUMENT_LENGTH`. When unspecified, any
> extended JSON representation of a document which is longer than the default max length MUST be truncated to that
> length. When set to an integer value, any extended JSON document longer than that value MUST be truncated to that
> length. If a variable is set to an invalid value, it MUST be treated as if it were not specified at all, and the
> driver MAY attempt to warn the user about the misconfiguration via a log message or otherwise but MUST NOT throw an
> exception.

#### Components

Drivers MUST support configuring minimum log severity levels on a per-component level. The below components currently
exist and correspond to the listed specifications. This list is expected to grow over time as logging is added to more
specifications.

Drivers SHOULD specify the component names in whatever the idiomatic way is for their language. For example, the Java
command component could be named `org.mongodb.driver.protocol.command`.

Drivers MAY define additional language-specific components in addition to these for any driver-specific messages they
produce.

| Component Name  | Specification(s)                                                                                               | Environment Variable           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| command         | [Command Logging and Monitoring](../command-logging-and-monitoring/command-logging-and-monitoring.md)          | `MONGODB_LOG_COMMAND`          |
| topology        | [Server Discovery and Monitoring](../server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.md)       | `MONGODB_LOG_TOPOLOGY`         |
| serverSelection | [Server Selection](../server-selection/server-selection.md)                                                    | `MONGODB_LOG_SERVER_SELECTION` |
| connection      | [Connection Monitoring and Pooling](../connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.md) | `MONGODB_LOG_CONNECTION`       |

#### Log Severity Levels

Driver specifications defining log messages MUST use log levels from the following list, inspired by the Syslog Protocol
as described in [RFC 5424](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5424):

| Code | Level Name    | Meaning                                                                                                                                            | Environment Variable value (case-insensitive) |
| ---- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| -    | Off           | Nothing is logged.                                                                                                                                 | `off`                                         |
| 0    | Emergency     | -                                                                                                                                                  | `emergency`                                   |
| 1    | Alert         | -                                                                                                                                                  | `alert`                                       |
| 2    | Critical      | -                                                                                                                                                  | `critical`                                    |
| 3    | Error         | Any error that we are unable to report to the user via driver API.                                                                                 | `error`                                       |
| 4    | Warning       | Indicates a situation where undesirable application behavior may occur. Example: The driver ignores an unrecognized option in a connection string. | `warn`                                        |
| 5    | Notice        | Indicates an event that is unusual but not problematic. Example: a change stream is automatically resumed.                                         | `notice`                                      |
| 6    | Informational | High-level information about normal driver behavior. Example: `MongoClient` creation or close.                                                     | `info`                                        |
| 7    | Debug         | Detailed information that may be helpful when debugging an application. Example: A command starting.                                               | `debug`                                       |
| 8    | Trace         | Very fine-grained details related to logic flow. Example: entering and exiting function bodies.                                                    | `trace`                                       |

Note that the Emergency, Alert, and Critical levels have been intentionally left undefined. At the time of writing this
specification, we do not expect any driver specifications to need to log at these levels, but we have included them in
the list of permitted levels for consistency with Syslog.

The levels above are defined in order from most to least severe. Not all logging frameworks will necessarily support all
of these levels. If an equivalent level is not available, drivers MUST emit messages for that level at the closest, less
severe level if one is available, or the closest more severe level otherwise.

For example:

- If an Informational level is not available and Debug is, messages defined as Informational in a specification MUST be
  emitted at Debug level.
- If a Trace level is not available, Trace messages MUST be emitted at Debug level.

#### Structured versus Unstructured Logging

If structured logging is available in and idiomatic for the driver's language/ecosystem, the driver SHOULD produce
structured log messages. Note that some ecosystems with structured logging support may also have support available to
convert structured output to traditional unstructured messages for users who want it (for example, the
[log feature](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/#emitting-log-records) in Rust's
[tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) crate). If such support is available, drivers SHOULD utilize it to
support both types of logging.

Note that drivers implementing unstructured logging MUST still support some internal way to intercept the data contained
in messages in a structured form, as this is required to implement the unified tests for logging conformance. See the
[unified test format specification](../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.md#expectedlogmessage) for details.

#### Representing Documents in Log Messages

BSON documents MUST be represented in relaxed extended JSON when they appear in log messages to improve readability.

#### Representing Errors in Log Messages

Drivers MAY represent errors in log messages in whatever format is idiomatic for their language and existing error
types. For example, if a driver's error classes have existing `toString()` implementations, those MAY be used.
Alternatively, if a driver emits structured log messages, a structured format containing error data could be used. Any
information which a driver reports via its error classes MUST be included in the log representations. Note that if the
driver includes full server responses in its errors these MUST be truncated in accordance with the max document length
option.

#### Logging Failures

Specifications MAY define log messages that correspond to failures which also are reported via exceptions in the API,
for example a "command failed" log message. Such messages MUST NOT use log levels more severe than `debug`.

While it might seem natural that such messages would be logged at `error` level, not all failures that the driver
considers worthy of an error will be considered a true error by the application. For example, consider an application
that unconditionally creates a collection on startup, and ignores any `NamespaceExists` errors received in response: it
would be undesirable for those failures to show up in application logs at `error` level.

Additionally, some applications will already have infrastructure in place to log any unhandled exceptions at `error`
level. If the driver were to log exception-related messages at `error` level, such applications would end up with
duplicate, `error`-level messages for these exceptions. On the other hand, some applications may not log exceptions at
all, or might not include all of the relevant information about an encountered exception in their custom log messages;
for these applications, there is value in a driver emitting such log messages.

Given this, logging such messages at `debug` level strikes the best balance between making the diagnostic information
available, but not overloading users with overly severe and/or duplicative messages. Users who do not log exceptions
will have a way to see driver exceptions, by turning on `debug` logging, while users who do log exceptions can filter
for the true exceptions by only looking at more severe log levels.

#### Omitting Null Values from Log Messages

Some log messages will include fields that are only present under particular circumstances, for example on certain
server versions. When such a field is not present:

- If the driver does structured logging, the field MUST be omitted from the message altogether, i.e. the field MUST not
  be present with an explicit null value.
- If the driver does unstructured logging, the corresponding segment of the message string MUST be omitted altogether.

#### Performance Considerations

The computation required to generate certain log messages can be significant, e.g. if extended JSON serialization is
required. If possible, drivers SHOULD check whether a log message would actually be emitted and consumed based on the
users' configuration before doing such computation. For example, this can be checked in Rust via
[log::log_enabled](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/macro.log_enabled.html).

Drivers SHOULD optimize extended JSON generation to avoid generating JSON strings longer than will be emitted, such that
the complexity is O(N) where N = `<max document length>`, rather than N = `<actual document length>`.

#### Standard Naming in Structured Log Messages

Driver specifications typically allow for language-appropriate naming variations, e.g. using snakecase or camelcase to
name a property. However, for log messages, drivers doing structured logging MUST use the exact names and casing
specified for the names of fields included in messages. This will be easier for our support team since the names will be
consistent across languages, and will simplify writing language-agnostic tooling to search through and parse structured
logs.

#### Including Timestamps in Log Messages

Drivers MAY add timestamps to their log messages if one will not be added automatically by the logging framework(s) they
use.

#### Supporting Both Programmatic and Environment Variable Configuration

If a driver supports configuration via both environment variables and programmatically via API, programmatic
configuration MUST take precedence over environment variables. Drivers supporting both forms of configuration MUST
document this behavior and MUST provide an example of how users can implement custom logic to allow an environment
variable to override a programmatic default, so that users who prefer the opposite behavior have a way to achieve it.

## Test Plan

Tests for logging behavior are defined in each corresponding specification. The
[unified test runner specification](../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.md) has support for specifying logging
expectations in tests.

## Motivation for Change

A common complaint from our support team is that they don't know how to easily get debugging information from drivers.
Some drivers provide debug logging, but others do not. For drivers that do provide it, the log messages produced and the
mechanisms for enabling debug logging are inconsistent.

Although users can implement their own debug logging support via existing driver events (SDAM, APM, etc), this requires
code changes. It is often difficult to quickly implement and deploy such changes in production at the time they are
needed, and to remove the changes afterward. Additionally, there are useful scenarios to log that do not correspond to
existing events. Standardizing on debug log messages that drivers produce and how to enable/configure logging will
provide TSEs, CEs, and MongoDB users an easier way to get debugging information out of our drivers, facilitate support
of drivers for our internal teams, and improve our documentation around troubleshooting.

## Design Rationale

### Truncation of large documents

1. Why have an option?

   We considered a number of approaches for dealing with documents of potentially very large size in log messages, e.g.
   command documents, including 1) always logging the full document, 2) only logging documents with the potential to be
   large when the user opts in, and 3) truncating large documents by default, but allowing the user to adjust the
   maximum length logged. We chose the third option as we felt it struck the best balance between concerns around
   readability and usability of log messages. In the case where data is sufficiently small, the default behavior will
   show the user the full data. In the case where data is large, the user will receive a readable message with truncated
   data, but have the option to see more or all of the data.

2. Why are the units for max document length flexible?

   String APIs vary across languages, and not all drivers will be able to easily and efficiently truncate strings in the
   same exact manner. The important thing is that the option exists and that its default value is reasonable, and for
   all possible unit choices (byte, code point, code unit, or grapheme) we felt 1000 was a reasonable default. See
   [here](https://exploringjs.com/impatient-js/ch_unicode.html) for a helpful primer on related Unicode concepts.

3. Why do we implement naive truncation rather than truncating the JSON so it is still valid?

   Designing and implementing a truncation algorithm for JSON that outputs valid JSON, but fits in as much of the
   original JSON as possible, would be non-trivial. The server team wrote an entire separate truncation design document
   when they implemented this for their log messages. This is more of a necessity for the server where the entire log
   message is JSON, but we don't know if parsing the documents included in log messages is something that users will
   actually need to do. Furthermore, any users who want parseable documents have an escape hatch to do so: they can set
   the max document length to a very large value. If we hear of use cases in the future for parsing the documents in log
   messages, we could make an additive change to this specification to permit a smarter truncation algorithm.

### Structured versus Unstructured Logging

The MongoDB server produces structured logs as of 4.4, so it seems natural that MongoDB drivers might too. However,
structured logging is not idiomatic or common in some language ecosystems, so we have chosen not to require it.

### Omitting Null Values from Log Messages

We considered alternatives such as allowing, or requiring, drivers to explicitly include null values in log messages.
While this might make it easier to identify cases where a value is unexpectedly null, we decided against it because
there are a number of values that will often be null, or even always be null for certain applications (e.g. `serviceId`
when not connected to a load-balanced topology) and their inclusion may confuse users and lead them to think the null
value is meaningful. Additionally, always including null values would increase the size of log messages. The omission of
null values is left to the drivers' discretion for any driver-specific logs not covered by common specification
components.

### Invalid Values of Environment Variables

For drivers supporting configuration via environment variables, the spec requires that if an environment variable is set
to an invalid value the driver behaves as if the value were not specified at all, and optionally warns the user but does
not throw an error. We considered the following alternatives:

1. Drivers could be required to throw an exception if a value is invalid: This was rejected because of concerns around
   the implications for environments/applications where multiple versions of the driver or multiple drivers may be
   present and where the validation logic may not match, meaning a value considered valid for one driver/version might
   not be by another. Additionally, there is no obvious place to throw an exception from about invalid environment
   variables; `MongoClient` constructors would be one possibility, but not all languages will support per-client
   configuration so throwing there regarding an environment variable might be surprising to users.

   Note that these same concerns do not apply to logging options that are specified via driver API: there is no risk of
   such options propagating to other drivers/driver versions present, and drivers can report exceptions at the point the
   options are specified, either globally or per-client. Therefore, drivers MUST validate programmatic logging options
   in a manner consistent with how they validate all other programmatic options, and if possible SHOULD prefer to throw
   exceptions for invalid configuration.

2. Drivers could be required to log a warning if a value is invalid: While drivers MAY do this, requiring it was
   rejected because depending on the language/framework log messages may not be a viable way to communicate a warning:
   if a language's default behavior is to log nothing, or only log messages at a more severe level than `warn`, the user
   will not actually receive the message unless it is logged at a level and component they have successfully enabled.

### Programmatic Configuration Taking Precedence

We chose to have programmatic configuration win out over environment variables because:

1. This allows applications built atop drivers (e.g. mongosh) to fully control the driver's logging behavior by setting
   options for it programmatically.
2. This is consistent with how many drivers treat options specified both in a connection string and programmatically:
   programmatic options win out.
3. It is straightforward for users to override this behavior (by writing logic to read in environment variables and
   override programmatic defaults), but if we went with the opposite default, it would be more complicated for users to
   override: not all languages will necessarily have an easy way to override/unset an environment variable from within
   application code.

## Backwards Compatibility

This specification takes the stance that the contents of log messages (both structured and unstructured) are *not*
covered by semantic versioning, but that logging components *are*, since changing the name of a component or removing a
component altogether has the potential to break user logging configuration and cause users to silently miss log
messages.

As a result, any drivers that already support logging should be free to update the messages they log to match those
defined in various specifications. However, drivers should take care to avoid removing or renaming existing logging
components except in major version releases.

Since this specification defines no particular API, drivers are free to keep any existing programmatic APIs they have
for configuring logging. If such APIs are incompatible with the logging specification requirements (for example, the
driver defines its own set of log levels in a public type, which do not match the spec-defined levels), changes to match
the specification should be staged in via semantic versioning.

## Reference Implementation

Links to be added once Rust and C# implementations have been merged.

## Security Implication

Drivers must take care to avoid exposing sensitive information (e.g. authentication credentials) in log messages. It
will be up to each individual specification that defines log messages to define which information should be redacted and
add tests confirming its redaction.

## Future work

### Additional Log Components

Additional log components may be added as logging is added to more specifications.

### Preventing Recursion When Using MongoDB as a Log Sink

If a user chooses to store log messages produced by a driver in MongoDB, it may be possible for them to end up recursing
infinitely if each write to store a log message generates additional log messages. This has historically not been an
issue in drivers that already produce log messages, or with the command monitoring API, but if users start to run into
this issue, we could try to address it at the specification level by e.g. requiring drivers to support disabling logging
on individual clients or for particular namespaces.

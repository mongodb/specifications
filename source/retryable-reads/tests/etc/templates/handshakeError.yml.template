tests:
  # Because setting a failPoint creates a connection in the connection pool, run
  # a ping operation that fails immediately after the failPoint operation in
  # order to discard the connection before running the actual operation to be
  # tested. The saslContinue command is used to avoid SDAM errors.
  #
  # Description of events:
  # - Failpoint operation.
  #   - Creates a connection in the connection pool that must be closed.
  # - Ping operation.
  #   - Triggers failpoint (first time).
  #   - Closes the connection made by the fail point operation.
  # - Test operation.
  #   - New connection is created.
  #   - Triggers failpoint (second time).
  #   - Tests whether operation successfully retries the handshake and succeeds.

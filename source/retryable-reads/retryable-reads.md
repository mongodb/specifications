# Retryable Reads

- Status: Accepted
- Minimum Server Version: 3.6

______________________________________________________________________

## Abstract

This specification is about the ability for drivers to automatically retry any read operation that has not yet received
any resultsâ€”due to a transient network error, a "not writable primary" error after a replica set failover, etc.

This specification will

- outline how an API for retryable read operations will be implemented in drivers
- define an option to enable retryable reads for an application.

## META

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## Specification

### Terms

#### Retryable Error

An error is considered retryable if it meets any of the criteria defined under
[Retryable Writes: Terms: Retryable Error](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#terms), minus the final criterion
about write concern errors. For convenience, the relevant criteria have been adapted to retryable reads and reproduced
below.

An error is considered retryable if it meets any of the following criteria:

- any network exception (e.g. socket timeout or error)
- a server error response with any the following codes:

| **Error Name**                     | **Error Code** |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| ExceededTimeLimit                  | 262            |
| InterruptedAtShutdown              | 11600          |
| InterruptedDueToReplStateChange    | 11602          |
| NotWritablePrimary                 | 10107          |
| NotPrimaryNoSecondaryOk            | 13435          |
| NotPrimaryOrSecondary              | 13436          |
| PrimarySteppedDown                 | 189            |
| ReadConcernMajorityNotAvailableYet | 134            |
| ShutdownInProgress                 | 91             |
| HostNotFound                       | 7              |
| HostUnreachable                    | 6              |
| NetworkTimeout                     | 89             |
| SocketException                    | 9001           |

- a [PoolClearedError](../connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.md#connection-pool-errors)
- Any of the above retryable errors that occur during a connection handshake (including the authentication step). For
  example, a network error or ShutdownInProgress error encountered when running the hello or saslContinue commands.

### MongoClient Configuration

This specification introduces the following client-level configuration option.

#### retryReads

This boolean option determines whether retryable behavior will be applied to all read operations executed within the
MongoClient. This option MUST default to true.
[As with retryable writes](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#retrywrites), this option MUST NOT be configurable at
the level of an individual read operation, collection object, or database object. Drivers that expose a "high" and
"core" API (e.g. Java and C# driver) MUST NOT expose a configurable option at the level of an individual read operation,
collection object, or database object in "high", but MAY expose the option in "core."

##### Naming Deviations

[As with retryable writes](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#retrywrites), drivers MUST use the defined name of
`retryReads` for the connection string parameter to ensure portability of connection strings across applications and
drivers. If drivers solicit MongoClient options through another mechanism (e.g. an options dictionary provided to the
MongoClient constructor), drivers SHOULD use the defined name but MAY deviate to comply with their existing conventions.
For example, a driver may use `retry_reads` instead of `retryReads`. For any other names in the spec, drivers SHOULD use
the defined name but MAY deviate to comply with their existing conventions.

### Requirements for Retryable Reads

#### Supported Server Versions

Drivers MUST verify server eligibility by ensuring that `maxWireVersion` is at least 6 because retryable reads require a
MongoDB 3.6 standalone, replica set or shard cluster, MongoDB 3.6 server wire version is 6 as defined in the
[Server Wire version and Feature List specification](../wireversion-featurelist/wireversion-featurelist.md).

The minimum server version is 3.6 because

1. It gives us version parity with retryable writes.
2. It forces the retry attempt(s) to use the same implicit session, which would make it it easier to track operations
   and kill any errant longer running operation.
3. It limits the scope of the implementation (`OP_QUERY` will not need to be supported).

#### Supported Read Operations

Drivers MUST support retryability for the following operations:

- All read operations defined in the CRUD specification i.e.

  - `Collection.find()`

    - This includes the `find` operations backing the GridFS API.

  - `Collection.aggregate()`

    - Only if the pipeline does not include a write stage (e.g. `$out`, `$merge`)

  - `Collection.distinct()`

  - `Collection.count()`

    - Only required if the driver already provides `count()`

  - `Collection.estimatedDocumentCount()`

  - `Collection.countDocuments()`

- All read operation helpers in the change streams specification i.e.

  - `Collection.watch()`
  - `Database.watch()`
  - `MongoClient.watch()`

- All enumeration commands e.g.

  - `MongoClient.listDatabases()`
  - `Database.listCollections()`
  - `Collection.listIndexes()`

- Any read operations not defined in the aforementioned specifications:

  - Any read operation helpers e.g. `Collection.findOne()`

Drivers SHOULD support retryability for the following operations:

- Any driver that provides generic command runners for read commands (with logic to inherit a client-level read
  concerns) SHOULD implement retryability for the read-only command runner.

Most of the above methods are defined in the following specifications:

- [Change Streams](../change-streams/change-streams.md)
- [CRUD](../crud/crud.md)
- [Enumerating Collections](../enumerate-collections/enumerate-collections.md)
- [Enumerating Indexes](../index-management/index-management.md#enumerate-indexes)
- [Enumerating Databases](../enumerate-databases/enumerate-databases.md)
- [GridFS Spec](../gridfs/gridfs-spec.md)

#### Unsupported Read Operations

Drivers MUST NOT retry the following operations:

- `Collection.mapReduce()`
  - This is due to the "Early Failure on Socket Disconnect" feature not supporting `mapReduce`.
  - N.B. If `mapReduce` is executed via a generic command runner for read commands, drivers SHOULD NOT inspect the
    command to prevent `mapReduce` from retrying.
- Cursor.getMore()
  - See [Why is retrying Cursor.getMore() not supported?](#why-is-retrying-cursorgetmore-not-supported)
- The generic runCommand helper, even if it is passed a read command.
  - N.B.: This applies only to a generic command runner, which is agnostic about the read/write nature of the command.

### Implementing Retryable Reads

#### Executing Retryable Read Commands

Executing retryable read commands is extremely similar to
[executing retryable write commands](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#executing-retryable-write-commands). The
following explanation for executing retryable read commands has been adapted from the explanation for executing
retryable write commands.

##### 1. Selecting the initial server

The driver selects the initial server for the command as usual. When selecting a server for the first attempt of a
retryable read command, drivers MUST allow a server selection error to propagate. In this case, the caller is able to
infer that no attempt was made.

##### 2. Determining whether retry should be allowed

A driver then determines if it should attempt to retry next.

###### 2a. When not to allow retry

Drivers MUST attempt to execute the read command exactly once and allow any errors to propagate under any of the the
following conditions:

- if retryable reads is not enabled **or**
- if the selected server does not support retryable reads **or**
- if the session in a transaction

By allowing the error to propagate, the caller is able to infer that one attempt was made.

###### 2b. When to allow retry

Drivers MUST only attempt to retry a read command if

- retryable reads are enabled **and**
- the selected server supports retryable reads **and**
- the previous attempt yields a retryable error

##### 3. Deciding to allow retry, encountering the initial retryable error, and selecting a server

If the driver decides to allow retry and the previous attempt of a retryable read command encounters a retryable error,
the driver MUST update its topology according to the Server Discovery and Monitoring spec (see
[SDAM: Error Handling](../server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.md#error-handling)) and
capture this original retryable error. Drivers should then proceed with selecting a server for a retry attempt.

###### 3a. Selecting the server for retry

In a sharded cluster, the server on which the operation failed MUST be provided to the server selection mechanism as a
deprioritized server.

If the driver cannot select a server for a retry attempt or the newly selected server does not support retryable reads,
retrying is not possible and drivers MUST raise the previous retryable error. In both cases, the caller is able to infer
that an attempt was made.

###### 3b. Sending an equivalent command for a retry attempt

After server selection, a driver MUST send a valid command to the newly selected server that is equivalent[^1] to the
initial command sent to the first server. If the driver determines that the newly selected server may not be able to
support a command equivalent to the initial command, drivers MUST NOT retry and MUST raise the previous retryable error

The above requirement can be fulfilled in one of two ways:

1. During a retry attempt, the driver SHOULD recreate the command while adhering to that operation's specification's
   server/wire version requirements. If an error occurs while recreating the command, then the driver MUST raise the
   original retryable error.

   For example, if the wire version dips from *W*<sub>0</sub> to *W*<sub>1</sub> after server selection, and the spec
   for operation *O* notes that for wire version *W*<sub>1</sub>, that field *F* should be omitted, then field *F*
   should be omitted. If the spec for operation *O* requires the driver to error out if field *F* is defined when
   talking to a server with wire version *W*<sub>1</sub>, then the driver must error out and raise the original
   retryable error.

2. Alternatively, if a driver chooses not to recreate the command as described above, then a driver MUST NOT retry if
   the server/wire version dips after server selection and MUST raise the original retryable error.

   For example, if the wire version dips after server selection, the driver can choose to not retry and simply raise the
   original retryable error because there is no guarantee that the lower versioned server can support the original
   command.

###### 3c. If a retry attempt fails

If a retry attempt also fails and
[Client Side Operations Timeout](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md) (CSOT) is enabled
and the timeout has not yet expired, then the Driver MUST jump back to step 2b above in order to allow multiple retry
attempts.

Otherwise, drivers MUST update their topology according to the SDAM spec (see
[SDAM: Error Handling](../server-discovery-and-monitoring/server-discovery-and-monitoring.md#error-handling)). If an
error would not allow the caller to infer that an attempt was made (e.g. connection pool exception originating from the
driver), the previous error should be raised. If a retry failed due to another retryable error or some other error
originating from the server, that error should be raised instead as the caller can infer that an attempt was made and
the second error is likely more relevant (with respect to the current topology state).

If a driver associates server information (e.g. the server address or description) with an error, the driver MUST ensure
that the reported server information corresponds to the server that originated the error.

##### 4. Implementation constraints

When retrying a read command, drivers MUST NOT resend the original wire protocol message (see:
[Can drivers resend the same wire protocol message on retry attempts?](#can-drivers-resend-the-same-wire-protocol-message-on-retry-attempts)).

#### Pseudocode

The following pseudocode for executing retryable read commands has been adapted from
[the pseudocode for executing retryable write commands](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#executing-retryable-write-commands)
and reflects the flow described above.

```typescript
/**
 * Checks if a connection supports retryable reads.
 */
function isRetryableReadsSupported(connection) {
  return connection.MaxWireVersion >= RETRYABLE_READS_MIN_WIRE_VERSION);
}

/**
 * Executes a read command in the context of a MongoClient where a retryable
 * read have been enabled. The session parameter may be an implicit or
 * explicit client session (depending on how the CRUD method was invoked).
 */
function executeRetryableRead(command, session) {
  Exception previousError = null;
  retrying = false;
  Server previousServer = null;
  while true {
    if (previousError != null) {
      retrying = true;
    }
    try {
      if (previousServer == null) {
        server = selectServer();
      } else {
        // If a previous attempt was made, deprioritize the previous server
        // where the command failed.
        deprioritizedServers = [ previousServer ];
        server = selectServer(deprioritizedServers);
      }
    } catch (ServerSelectionException exception) {
      if (previousError == null) {
        // If this is the first attempt, propagate the exception.
        throw exception;
      }
      // For retries, propagate the previous error.
      throw previousError;
    }

    try {
      connection = server.getConnection();
    } catch (PoolClearedException poolClearedError) {
      /* PoolClearedException indicates the operation did not even attempt to
       * create a connection, let alone execute the operation. This means we
       * are always safe to attempt a retry. We do not need to update SDAM,
       * since whatever error caused the pool to be cleared will do so itself. */
      if (previousError == null) {
        previousError = poolClearedError;
      }
      /* CSOT is enabled and the operation has timed out. */
      if (timeoutMS != null && isExpired(timeoutMS) {
        throw previousError;
      }
      continue;
    }

    if ( !isRetryableReadsSupported(connection) || session.inTransaction()) {
      /* If this is the first loop iteration and we determine that retryable
       * reads are not supported, execute the command once and allow any
       * errors to propagate */

      if (previousError == null) {
        return executeCommand(connection, command);
      }

      /* If the server selected for retrying is too old, throw the previous error.
       * The caller can then infer that an attempt was made and failed. This case
       * is very rare, and likely means that the cluster is in the midst of a
       * downgrade. */
      throw previousError;
    }

    /* NetworkException and NotWritablePrimaryException are both retryable errors. If
     * caught, remember the exception, update SDAM accordingly, and proceed with
     * retrying the operation.
     *
     * Exceptions that originate from the driver (e.g. no socket available
     * from the connection pool) are treated as fatal. Any such exception
     * that occurs on the previous attempt is propagated as-is. On retries,
     * the error from the previous attempt is raised as it will be more
     * relevant for the user. */
    try {
      return executeCommand(connection, retryableCommand);
    } catch (NetworkException networkError) {
      updateTopologyDescriptionForNetworkError(server, networkError);
      previousError = networkError;
      previousServer = server;
    } catch (NotWritablePrimaryException notPrimaryError) {
      updateTopologyDescriptionForNotWritablePrimaryError(server, notPrimaryError);
      previousError = notPrimaryError;
      previousServer = server;
    } catch (DriverException error) {
      if ( previousError != null ) {
        throw previousError;
      }
      throw error;
    }

    if (timeoutMS == null) {
      /* If CSOT is not enabled, allow any retryable error from the second
       * attempt to propagate to our caller, as it will be just as relevant
       * (if not more relevant) than the original error. */
      if (retrying) {
        throw previousError;
      }
    } else if (isExpired(timeoutMS)) {
      /* CSOT is enabled and the operation has timed out. */

}
```

### Logging Retry Attempts

[As with retryable writes](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#logging-retry-attempts), drivers MAY choose to log
retry attempts for read operations. This specification does not define a format for such log messages.

### Command Monitoring

[As with retryable writes](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#command-monitoring), in accordance with the
[Command Logging and Monitoring](../command-logging-and-monitoring/command-logging-and-monitoring.md) specification,
drivers MUST guarantee that each `CommandStartedEvent` has either a correlating `CommandSucceededEvent` or
`CommandFailedEvent` and that every "command started" log message has either a correlating "command succeeded" log
message or "command failed" log message. If the first attempt of a retryable read operation encounters a retryable
error, drivers MUST fire a `CommandFailedEvent` and emit a "command failed" log message for the retryable error and fire
a separate `CommandStartedEvent` and emit a separate "command started" log message when executing the subsequent retry
attempt. Note that the second `CommandStartedEvent` and "command started" log message may have a different
`connectionId`, since a server is reselected for a retry attempt.

### Documentation

1. Drivers MUST document all read operations that support retryable behavior.
2. Drivers MUST document that the operations in [Unsupported Read Operations](#unsupported-read-operations) do not
   support retryable behavior.
3. Driver release notes MUST make it clear to users that they may need to adjust custom retry logic to prevent an
   application from inadvertently retrying for too long (see [Backwards Compatibility](#backwards-compatibility) for
   details).
4. Drivers implementing retryability for their generic command runner for read commands MUST document that `mapReduce`
   will be retried if it is passed as a command to the command runner. These drivers also MUST document the potential
   for degraded performance given that "Early Failure on Socket Disconnect" feature does not support `mapReduce`.

## Test Plan

See the [README](./tests/README.md) for tests.

At a high level, the test plan will cover executing supported read operations within a MongoClient where retryable reads
have been enabled, ensuring that reads are retried.

## Motivation for Change

Drivers currently have an API for the retryability of write operations but not for read operations. The driver API needs
to be extended to include support for retryable behavior for read operations.

## Design Rationale

The design of this specification is based off the
[Retryable Writes specification](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#design-rationale). It modifies the driver API
as little as possible to introduce the concept retryable behavior for read operations.

Alternative retry strategies (e.g. exponential back-off, incremental intervals, regular intervals, immediate retry,
randomization) were considered, but the behavior of a single, immediate retry attempt was chosen in the interests of
simplicity as well as consistency with the design for retryable writes.

See the [future work](#future-work) section for potential upcoming changes to retry mechanics.

## Backwards Compatibility

The API changes to support retryable reads extend the existing API but do not introduce any backward breaking changes.
Existing programs that do not make use of retryable reads will continue to compile and run correctly.

N.B.: Applications with custom retry logic that choose to enable retryable reads may need to redo their custom retry
logic to ensure that the reads are retried as desired. e.g. if an application has custom logic that retries reads n
times and enables retryable reads, then the application could end up retrying reads up to 2n times.

The note above will also apply if an application upgrades to a version of the driver where that defaults to enabling
retryable reads.

### Rejected Designs

1. To improve performance on servers without "Early Failure on Socket Disconnect", we considered using `killSessions` to
   automatically kill the previous attempt before running a retry. We decided against this because after killing the
   session, parts of it still may be running if there are any errors. Additionally, killing sessions takes time because
   a kill has to talk to every non-config `mongod` in the cluster (i.e. all the primaries and secondaries of each
   shard). In addition, in order to protect the system against getting overloaded with these requests, every server
   allows no more than one killsession operation at a time. Operations that attempt to `killsessions` while a
   killsession is running are batched together and run simultaneously after the current one finishes.

## Reference Implementation

The C# and Python drivers will provide the reference implementations. See
[CSHARP-2429](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-2429) and
[PYTHON-1674](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-1674).

## Security Implications

None.

## Future work

1. A later specification may allow operations (including read) to be retried any number of times during a singular
   timeout period.
2. Any future changes to the the applicable parts of
   [retryable writes specification](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md) may also need to be reflected in the
   retryable reads specification, and vice versa.
3. We may revisit the decision not retry `Cursor.getMore()` (see [Q&A](#qa)).
4. Once [DRIVERS-560](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-560) is resolved, tests will be added to allow testing
   Retryable Reads on MongoDB 3.6. See the [test plan](./tests/README.md) for additional information.

## Q&A

### Why is retrying `Cursor.getMore()` not supported?

`Cursor.getMore()` cannot be retried because of the inability for the client to discern if the cursor was advanced. In
other words, since the driver does not know if the original `getMore()` succeeded or not, the driver cannot reliably
know if results might be inadvertently skipped.

For example, if a transient network error occurs as a driver requests the second batch of results via a getMore() and
the driver were to silently retry the `getMore()`, it is possible that the server had actually received the initial
`getMore()`. In such a case, the server will advance the cursor once more and return the third batch instead of the
desired second batch.

Furthermore, even if the driver could detect such a scenario, it is impossible to return previously iterated data from a
cursor because the server currently only allows forward iteration.

It is worth noting that the "Cursors survive primary stepdown" feature avoids this issue in certain common
circumstances, so that we may revisit this decision to disallow trying `getMore()` in the future.

### Why are read operations only retried once by default?

[Read operations are only retried once for the same reasons that writes are also only retried once.](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#why-are-write-operations-only-retried-once-by-default)
For convenience's sake, that reasoning has been adapted for reads and reproduced below:

The spec concerns itself with retrying read operations that encounter a retryable error (i.e. no response due to network
error or a response indicating that the node is no longer a primary). A retryable error may be classified as either a
transient error (e.g. dropped connection, replica set failover) or persistent outage. If a transient error results in
the server being marked as "unknown", a subsequent retry attempt will allow the driver to rediscover the primary within
the designated server selection timeout period (30 seconds by default). If server selection times out during this retry
attempt, we can reasonably assume that there is a persistent outage. In the case of a persistent outage, multiple retry
attempts are fruitless and would waste time. See
[How To Write Resilient MongoDB Applications](https://emptysqua.re/blog/how-to-write-resilient-mongodb-applications/)
for additional discussion on this strategy.

However when [Client Side Operations Timeout](../client-side-operations-timeout/client-side-operations-timeout.md) is
enabled, the driver will retry multiple times until the operation succeeds, a non-retryable error is encountered, or the
timeout expires. Retrying multiple times provides greater resilience to cascading failures such as rolling server
restarts during planned maintenance events.

### Can drivers resend the same wire protocol message on retry attempts?

No.
[This is in contrast to the answer supplied in in the retryable writes specification.](../retryable-writes/retryable-writes.md#can-drivers-resend-the-same-wire-protocol-message-on-retry-attempts)
However, when retryable writes were implemented, no driver actually chose to resend the same wire protocol message.
Today, if a driver attempted to resend the same wire protocol message, this could violate
[the rules for gossiping $clusterTime](../sessions/driver-sessions.md#gossipping-the-cluster-time): specifically
[the rule that a driver must send the highest seen $clusterTime](../sessions/driver-sessions.md#sending-the-highest-seen-cluster-time).

Additionally, there would be a behavioral difference between a driver resending the same wire protocol message and one
that does not. For example, a driver that creates a new wire protocol message could exhibit the following
characteristics:

1. The second attempt to send the read command could have a higher `$clusterTime`.
2. If the initial attempt failed with a server error, then the session's `operationTime` would be advanced and the next
   read would include a larger `readConcern.afterClusterTime`.

A driver that resends the same wire protocol message would not exhibit the above characteristics. Thus, in order to
avoid this behavioral difference and not violate the rules about gossiping `$clusterTime`, drivers MUST not resend the
same wire protocol message.

### Why isn't MongoDB 4.2 required?

MongoDB 4.2 was initially considered as a requirement for retryable reads because MongoDB 4.2 implements support for
"Early Failure on Socket Disconnect," changing the the semantics of socket disconnect to prevent ops from doing work
that no client is interested in. This prevents applications from seeing degraded performance when an expensive read is
retried. Upon further discussion, we decided that "Early Failure on Socket Disconnect" should not be required to retry
reads because the resilience benefit of retryable reads outweighs the minor risk of degraded performance. Additionally,
any customers experiencing degraded performance can simply disable `retryableReads`.

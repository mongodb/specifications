============
MongoDB OIDC
============

Drivers MUST test the following scenarios:

- ``Callback-Driven Auth``
- ``AWS Automatic Auth``
- ``Callback Validation``
- ``Cached Credentials``
- ``Speculative Authentication``
- ``Reauthentication``


.. sectnum::

Drivers MUST be able to authenticate using either authentication or provider
name if there are multiple principals configured on the server.  Note that
``directConnection=true`` and ``readPreference=secondaryPreferred`` are needed because the server is a secondary on a replica set, on port ``27018``.

Drivers will need to be able to internally query and clear the cached
credentials to verify usage for testing purposes.  Clearing the cache
means removing all data from the cache, including ``OIDCMechanismServerStep1``
information.

Drivers MUST set the ``AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`` environment variable
to the location of valid ``test_user1`` credentials.

Unless otherwise specified, tests will use a URL
of the form ``mongodb://localhost/?authMechanism=MONGODB-OIDC``.


Callback-Driven Auth
====================

Drivers MUST be able to authenticate using OIDC callback(s) when there
is one principal configured.

  to the location of valid ``test_user2`` credentials.

Callback Validation
===================

Valid Callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create request and refresh callback that validate their inputs and return
  a valid token.  The request callback must return a token that expires in
  one minute.
- Create a client that uses the above callbacks.
- Perform a ``find`` operation that succeeds.  Verify that the request
  callback was called with the appropriate inputs, including the timeout
  parameter if possible.  Ensure that there are no unexpected fields.
- Perform another ``find`` operation that succeeds.  Verify that the refresh
  callback was called with the appropriate inputs, including the timeout
  parameter if possible.
- Close the client.

Request Callback Returns Null
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create a client with a request callback that returns ``null``.
- Perform a ``find`` operation that fails.
- Close the client.

Refresh Callback Returns Null
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Perform a ``find`` operation that succeeds.
- Close the client.
- Create a new client with the same callbacks.
- Perform a ``find`` operation that fails.
- Close the client.

Cached Credentials
==================

Drivers MUST ensure that they are testing the ability to cache credentials.
Unless otherwise specified, the tests MUST be performed with the callback-driven workflow with a provided request and refresh callback. If
desired, the caching tests MAY be done using mock server responses.
The following tests assume a global cache is in use.  If a different
cache scheme is in use, appropriate tests MUST be written to ensure that
the cache is performing as intended.

Cache with refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create a new client with a request callback that gives credentials that
  expire in on minute.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation adds credentials to the cache.
- Close the client.
- Create a new client with the same request callback and a refresh callback.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation results in a call to the refresh callback.
- Close the client.

Cache with no refresh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create a new client with a request callback that gives credentials that
  expire in one minute.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation adds credentials to the cache.
- Close the client.
- Create a new client with the a request callback but no refresh callback.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation results in a call to the request callback.
- Close the client.

Cache key includes callback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the driver does not support using callback references or hashes as part of
the cache key, skip this test.  This test ensures that the callback is
considered as part of the cache key.

- Clear the cache.
- Create a new client with a request callback that does not give an
  ```expiresInSeconds``` value.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation adds credentials to the cache.
- Close the client.
- Create a new client with a different request callback.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation adds a new entry to the cache.
- Close the client.

Error clears cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create a new client with a valid request callback that gives credentials
  that expire within 5 minutes and a refresh callback that gives invalid
  credentials.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation adds a new entry to the cache.
- Ensure that a subsequent ``find`` operation results in an error.
- Ensure that the cached token has been cleared.
- Close the client.

AWS Automatic workflow does not use cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create a new client that uses the AWS automatic workflow.
- Ensure that a ``find`` operation does not add credentials to the cache.
- Close the client.

Speculative Authentication
==========================
We can only test the successful case, by verifying that ``saslStart``
is not called.

- Clear the cache.
- Create a client with a request callback that returns a valid token
  that will not expire soon.
- Set a fail point for ``saslStart`` commands of the form:

.. code:: javascript

    {
      "configureFailPoint": "failCommand",
      "mode": {
        "times": 2
      },
      "data": {
        "failCommands": [
          "saslStart"
        ],
        "errorCode": 18
      }
    }

.. note::

  The driver MUST either use a unique ``appName`` or explicitly
  remove the ``failCommand`` after the test to prevent leakage.

- Perform a ``find`` operation that succeeds.
- Close the client.
- Create a new client with the same properties without clearing the cache.
- Set a fail point for ``saslStart`` commands.
- Perform a ``find`` operation that succeeds.
- Close the client.

Reauthentication
================

The driver MUST test reauthentication with MONGODB-OIDC for a read
operation.

Succeeds
~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create request and refresh callbacks that return valid credentials
  that will not expire soon.
- Create a client with the callbacks and an event listener capable
  of listening for SASL commands, if possible.
- Perform a ``find`` operation that succeeds.
- Assert that the refresh callback has not been called.
- Clear the listener state if possible.
- Force a reauthenication using a ``failCommand`` of the form:

.. code:: javascript

    {
      "configureFailPoint": "failCommand",
      "mode": {
        "times": 1
      },
      "data": {
        "failCommands": [
          "find"
        ],
        "errorCode": 391
      }
    }

.. note::

  the driver MUST either use a unique ``appName`` or explicitly
  remove the ``failCommand`` after the test to prevent leakage.

- Perform another find operation that succeeds.
- Assert that the refresh callback has been called once, if possible.
- Assert that the ordering of command started events is ``find``, ``saslStart``
  , ``find``.  Note that if the listener stat could not be cleared then there
  will and be extra ``find`` command.  If the driver does not emit
  ``saslStart`` events then they are not expected to be present.
- Assert that the ordering of command succeeded events is `saslStart`, `find`.
- Assert that a ``find`` operation failed once during the command execution.
- Close the client.

Retries and Succeeds with Cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Clear the cache.
- Create request and refresh callbacks that return valid credentials
  that will not expire soon.
- Perform a ``find`` operation that succeeds.
- Force a reauthenication using a ``failCommand`` of the form:

.. code:: javascript

    {
      "configureFailPoint": "failCommand",
      "mode": {
        "times": 2
      },
      "data": {
        "failCommands": [
          "find", "saslStart"
        ],
        "errorCode": 391
      }
    }

- Perform a ``find`` operation that succeeds.

.. code:: javascript

    {
      "configureFailPoint": "failCommand",
      "mode": {
        "times": 2
      },
      "data": {
        "failCommands": [
          "find", "saslStart"
        ],
        "errorCode": 391
      }
    }

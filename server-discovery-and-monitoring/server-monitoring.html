<h2 id="abstract"><a class="header" href="#abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>This spec defines how a driver monitors a MongoDB server. In summary, the client monitors each server in the topology.
The scope of server monitoring is to provide the topology with updated ServerDescriptions based on hello or legacy hello
command responses.</p>

<p>The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

<p>See the terms in the <a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html">main SDAM spec</a>.</p>
<h4 id="check"><a class="header" href="#check">check</a></h4>
<p>The client checks a server by attempting to call hello or legacy hello on it, and recording the outcome.</p>
<h4 id="client"><a class="header" href="#client">client</a></h4>
<p>A process that initiates a connection to a MongoDB server. This includes mongod and mongos processes in a replica set or
sharded cluster, as well as drivers, the shell, tools, etc.</p>
<h4 id="scan"><a class="header" href="#scan">scan</a></h4>
<p>The process of checking all servers in the deployment.</p>
<h4 id="suitable"><a class="header" href="#suitable">suitable</a></h4>
<p>A server is judged "suitable" for an operation if the client can use it for a particular operation. For example, a write
requires a standalone, primary, or mongos. Suitability is fully specified in the
<a href="../server-selection/server-selection.html">Server Selection Spec</a>.</p>
<h4 id="significant-topology-change"><a class="header" href="#significant-topology-change">significant topology change</a></h4>
<p>A change in the server's state that is relevant to the client's view of the server, e.g. a change in the server's
replica set member state, or its replica set tags. In SDAM terms, a significant topology change on the server means the
client's ServerDescription is out of date. Standalones and mongos do not currently experience significant topology
changes but they may in the future.</p>

<p>The serverMonitoringMode option configures which server monitoring protocol to use. Valid modes are "stream", "poll", or
"auto". The default value MUST be "auto":</p>
<ul>
<li>With "stream" mode, the client MUST use the streaming protocol when the server supports it or fall back to the polling
protocol otherwise.</li>
<li>With "poll" mode, the client MUST use the polling protocol.</li>
<li>With "auto" mode, the client MUST behave the same as "poll" mode when running on a FaaS platform or the same as
"stream" mode otherwise. The client detects that it's running on a FaaS platform via the same rules for generating the
<code>client.env</code> handshake metadata field in the <a href="../mongodb-handshake/handshake.html#client-env">MongoDB Handshake spec</a>.</li>

<h3 id="monitoring"><a class="header" href="#monitoring">Monitoring</a></h3>
<p>The client monitors servers using the hello or legacy hello commands. In MongoDB 4.4+, a monitor uses the
<a href="#streaming-protocol">Streaming Protocol</a> to continuously stream hello or legacy hello responses from the server. In
MongoDB &lt;= 4.2, a monitor uses the <a href="#polling-protocol">Polling Protocol</a> pausing heartbeatFrequencyMS between
<a href="#check">checks</a>. Clients check servers sooner in response to certain events.</p>
<p>If a <a href="../versioned-api/versioned-api.html">server API version</a> is requested, then the driver must use hello for
monitoring. If a server API version is not requested, the initial handshake using the legacy hello command must include
<code>helloOk: true</code>. If the response contains <code>helloOk: true</code>, then the driver must use the <code>hello</code> command for monitoring.
If the response does not contain <code>helloOk: true</code>, then the driver must use the legacy hello command for monitoring.</p>
<p>The socket used to check a server MUST use the same
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/">connectTimeoutMS</a> as regular sockets. Multi-threaded
clients SHOULD set monitoring sockets' socketTimeoutMS to the connectTimeoutMS. (See
<a href="#socket-timeout-for-monitoring-is-connecttimeoutms">socket timeout for monitoring is connectTimeoutMS</a>. Drivers MAY let
users configure the timeouts for monitoring sockets separately if necessary to preserve backwards compatibility.)</p>
<p>The client begins monitoring a server when:</p>
<ul>
<li>... the client is initialized and begins monitoring each seed. See
<a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#initial-servers">initial servers</a>.</li>
<li>... <a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#updateRSWithoutPrimary">updateRSWithoutPrimary</a> or
<a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#updateRSFromPrimary">updateRSFromPrimary</a> discovers new replica set members.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following subsections specify how monitoring works, first in multi-threaded or asynchronous clients, and second in
single-threaded clients. This spec provides detailed requirements for monitoring because it intends to make all drivers
behave consistently.</p>
<h4 id="multi-threaded-or-asynchronous-monitoring"><a class="header" href="#multi-threaded-or-asynchronous-monitoring">Multi-threaded or asynchronous monitoring</a></h4>
<h5 id="servers-are-monitored-in-parallel"><a class="header" href="#servers-are-monitored-in-parallel">Servers are monitored in parallel</a></h5>
<p>All servers' monitors run independently, in parallel: If some monitors block calling hello or legacy hello over slow
connections, other monitors MUST proceed unimpeded.</p>
<p>The natural implementation is a thread per server, but the decision is left to the implementer. (See
<a href="#thread-per-server">thread per server</a>.)</p>
<h5 id="servers-are-monitored-with-dedicated-sockets"><a class="header" href="#servers-are-monitored-with-dedicated-sockets">Servers are monitored with dedicated sockets</a></h5>
<p><a href="#a-monitor-should-not-use-the-clients-regular-connection-pool">A monitor SHOULD NOT use the client's regular connection pool</a>
to acquire a socket; it uses a dedicated socket that does not count toward the pool's maximum size.</p>
<p>Drivers MUST NOT authenticate on sockets used for monitoring nor include SCRAM mechanism negotiation (i.e.
<code>saslSupportedMechs</code>), as doing so would make monitoring checks more expensive for the server.</p>
<h5 id="servers-are-checked-periodically"><a class="header" href="#servers-are-checked-periodically">Servers are checked periodically</a></h5>
<p>Each monitor <a href="#check">checks</a> its server and notifies the client of the outcome so the client can update the
TopologyDescription.</p>
<p>After each check, the next check SHOULD be scheduled <a href="#heartbeatfrequencyms">heartbeatFrequencyMS</a> later; a check MUST
NOT run while a previous check is still in progress.</p>
<h5 id="requesting-an-immediate-check"><a class="header" href="#requesting-an-immediate-check">Requesting an immediate check</a></h5>
<p>At any time, the client can request that a monitor check its server immediately. (For example, after a "not writable
primary" error. See <a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#error-handling">error handling</a>.) If the monitor is sleeping
when this request arrives, it MUST wake and check as soon as possible. If a hello or legacy hello call is already in
progress, the request MUST be ignored. If the previous check ended less than
<a href="#minheartbeatfrequencyms">minHeartbeatFrequencyMS</a> ago, the monitor MUST sleep until the minimum delay has passed, then
check the server.</p>
<h5 id="application-operations-are-unblocked-when-a-server-is-found"><a class="header" href="#application-operations-are-unblocked-when-a-server-is-found">Application operations are unblocked when a server is found</a></h5>
<p>Each time a check completes, threads waiting for a <a href="#suitable">suitable</a> server are unblocked. Each unblocked thread
MUST proceed if the new TopologyDescription now contains a suitable server.</p>
<h5 id="clients-update-the-topology-from-each-handshake"><a class="header" href="#clients-update-the-topology-from-each-handshake">Clients update the topology from each handshake</a></h5>
<p>When a monitor check creates a new connection, the <a href="../mongodb-handshake/handshake.html">connection handshake</a> response
MUST be used to satisfy the check and update the topology.</p>
<p>When a client successfully calls hello or legacy hello to handshake a new connection for application operations, it
SHOULD use the hello or legacy hello reply to update the ServerDescription and TopologyDescription, the same as with a
hello or legacy hello reply on a monitoring socket. If the hello or legacy hello call fails, the client SHOULD mark the
server Unknown and update its TopologyDescription, the same as a failed server check on monitoring socket.</p>
<h5 id="clients-use-the-streaming-protocol-when-supported"><a class="header" href="#clients-use-the-streaming-protocol-when-supported">Clients use the streaming protocol when supported</a></h5>
<p>When a monitor discovers that the server supports the streamable hello or legacy hello command and the client does not
have <a href="#streaming-disabled">streaming disabled</a>, it MUST use the <a href="#streaming-protocol">streaming protocol</a>.</p>
<h4 id="single-threaded-monitoring"><a class="header" href="#single-threaded-monitoring">Single-threaded monitoring</a></h4>
<p><span id="cooldownms"></span></p>
<h5 id="cooldownms"><a class="header" href="#cooldownms">cooldownMS</a></h5>
<p>After a single-threaded client gets a network error trying to <a href="#check">check</a> a server, the client skips re-checking the
server until cooldownMS has passed.</p>
<p>This avoids spending connectTimeoutMS on each unavailable server during each scan.</p>
<p>This value MUST be 5000 ms, and it MUST NOT be configurable.</p>
<p><span id="scanning"></span></p>
<h5 id="scanning"><a class="header" href="#scanning">Scanning</a></h5>
<p>Single-threaded clients MUST <a href="#scan">scan</a> all servers synchronously, inline with regular application operations. Before
each operation, the client checks if <a href="#heartbeatfrequencyms">heartbeatFrequencyMS</a> has passed since the previous scan
ended, or if the topology is marked "stale"; if so it scans all the servers before selecting a server and performing the
operation.</p>
<p>Selection failure triggers an immediate scan. When a client that uses single-threaded monitoring fails to select a
suitable server for any operation, it <a href="#scan">scans</a> the servers, then attempts selection again, to see if the scan
discovered suitable servers. It repeats, waiting <a href="#minheartbeatfrequencyms">minHeartbeatFrequencyMS</a> after each scan,
until a timeout.</p>
<h5 id="scanning-order"><a class="header" href="#scanning-order">Scanning order</a></h5>
<p>If the topology is a replica set, the client attempts to contact the primary as soon as possible to get an authoritative
list of members. Otherwise, the client attempts to check all members it knows of, in order from the least-recently to
the most-recently checked.</p>
<p>When all servers have been checked the scan is complete. New servers discovered <strong>during</strong> the scan MUST be checked
before the scan is complete. Sometimes servers are removed during a scan so they are not checked, depending on the order
of events.</p>
<p>The scanning order is expressed in this pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>scanStartTime = now()
# You'll likely need to convert units here.
beforeCoolDown = scanStartTime - cooldownMS

while true:
    serversToCheck = all servers with lastUpdateTime before scanStartTime

    remove from serversToCheck any Unknowns with lastUpdateTime &gt; beforeCoolDown

    if no serversToCheck:
        # This scan has completed.
        break

    if a server in serversToCheck is RSPrimary:
        check it
    else if there is a PossiblePrimary:
        check it
    else if any servers are not of type Unknown or RSGhost:
        check the one with the oldest lastUpdateTime
        if several servers have the same lastUpdateTime, choose one at random
    else:
        check the Unknown or RSGhost server with the oldest lastUpdateTime
        if several servers have the same lastUpdateTime, choose one at random
</code></pre>
<p>This algorithm might be better understood with an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client is configured with one seed and TopologyType Unknown. It begins a scan.</li>
<li>When it checks the seed, it discovers a secondary.</li>
<li>The secondary's hello or legacy hello response includes the "primary" field with the address of the server that the
secondary thinks is primary.</li>
<li>The client creates a ServerDescription with that address, type PossiblePrimary, and lastUpdateTime "infinity ago".
(See <a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#updateRSWithoutPrimary">updateRSWithoutPrimary</a>.)</li>
<li>On the next iteration, there is still no RSPrimary, so the new PossiblePrimary is the top-priority server to check.</li>
<li>The PossiblePrimary is checked and replaced with an RSPrimary. The client has now acquired an authoritative host
list. Any new hosts in the list are added to the TopologyDescription with lastUpdateTime "infinity ago". (See
<a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#updateRSFromPrimary">updateRSFromPrimary</a>.)</li>
<li>The client continues scanning until all known hosts have been checked.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another common case might be scanning a pool of mongoses. When the client first scans its seed list, they all have the
default lastUpdateTime "infinity ago", so it scans them in random order. This randomness provides some load-balancing if
many clients start at once. A client's subsequent scans of the mongoses are always in the same order, since their
lastUpdateTimes are always in the same order by the time a scan ends.</p>
<h4 id="minheartbeatfrequencyms"><a class="header" href="#minheartbeatfrequencyms">minHeartbeatFrequencyMS</a></h4>
<p>If a client frequently rechecks a server, it MUST wait at least minHeartbeatFrequencyMS milliseconds since the previous
check ended, to avoid pointless effort. This value MUST be 500 ms, and it MUST NOT be configurable (no knobs).</p>
<h4 id="heartbeatfrequencyms"><a class="header" href="#heartbeatfrequencyms">heartbeatFrequencyMS</a></h4>
<p>The interval between server <a href="#check">checks</a>, counted from the end of the previous check until the beginning of the next
one.</p>
<p>For multi-threaded and asynchronous drivers it MUST default to 10 seconds and MUST be configurable. For single-threaded
drivers it MUST default to 60 seconds and MUST be configurable. It MUST be called heartbeatFrequencyMS unless this
breaks backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>For both multi- and single-threaded drivers, the driver MUST NOT permit users to configure it less than
minHeartbeatFrequencyMS (500ms).</p>
<p>(See <a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#heartbeatFrequencyMS">heartbeatFrequencyMS in the main SDAM spec</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="awaitable-hello-or-legacy-hello-server-specification"><a class="header" href="#awaitable-hello-or-legacy-hello-server-specification">Awaitable hello or legacy hello Server Specification</a></h3>
<p>As of MongoDB 4.4 the hello or legacy hello command can wait to reply until there is a topology change or a maximum time
has elapsed. Clients opt in to this "awaitable hello" feature by passing new parameters "topologyVersion" and
"maxAwaitTimeMS" to the hello or legacy hello commands. Exhaust support has also been added, which clients can enable in
the usual manner by setting the <a href="../message/OP_MSG.html#exhaustAllowed">OP_MSG exhaustAllowed flag</a>.</p>
<p>Clients use the awaitable hello feature as the basis of the streaming heartbeat protocol to learn much sooner about
stepdowns, elections, reconfigs, and other events.</p>
<h4 id="topologyversion"><a class="header" href="#topologyversion">topologyVersion</a></h4>
<p>A server that supports awaitable hello or legacy hello includes a "topologyVersion" field in all hello or legacy hello
replies and State Change Error replies. The topologyVersion is a subdocument with two fields, "processId" and "counter":</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">{
    topologyVersion: {processId: &lt;ObjectId&gt;, counter: &lt;int64&gt;},
    ( ... other fields ...)
}
</code></pre>
<h5 id="processid"><a class="header" href="#processid">processId</a></h5>
<p>An ObjectId maintained in memory by the server. It is reinitialized by the server using the standard ObjectId logic each
time this server process starts.</p>
<h5 id="counter"><a class="header" href="#counter">counter</a></h5>
<p>An int64 State change counter, maintained in memory by the server. It begins at 0 when the server starts, and it is
incremented whenever there is a significant topology change.</p>
<h4 id="maxawaittimems"><a class="header" href="#maxawaittimems">maxAwaitTimeMS</a></h4>
<p>To enable awaitable hello or legacy hello, the client includes a new int64 field "maxAwaitTimeMS" in the hello or legacy
hello request. This field determines the maximum duration in milliseconds a server will wait for a significant topology
change before replying.</p>
<h4 id="feature-discovery"><a class="header" href="#feature-discovery">Feature Discovery</a></h4>
<p>To discover if the connected server supports awaitable hello or legacy hello, a client checks the most recent hello or
legacy hello command reply. If the reply includes "topologyVersion" then the server supports awaitable hello or legacy
hello.</p>
<h4 id="awaitable-hello-or-legacy-hello-protocol"><a class="header" href="#awaitable-hello-or-legacy-hello-protocol">Awaitable hello or legacy hello Protocol</a></h4>
<p>To initiate an awaitable hello or legacy hello command, the client includes both maxAwaitTimeMS and topologyVersion in
the request, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">{
    hello: 1,
    maxAwaitTimeMS: 10000,
    topologyVersion: {processId: &lt;ObjectId&gt;, counter: &lt;int64&gt;},
    ( ... other fields ...)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Clients MAY additionally set the <a href="../message/OP_MSG.html#exhaustAllowed">OP_MSG exhaustAllowed flag</a> to enable streaming
hello or legacy hello. With streaming hello or legacy hello, the server MAY send multiple hello or legacy hello
responses without waiting for further requests.</p>
<p>A server that implements the new protocol follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always include the server's topologyVersion in hello, legacy hello, and State Change Error replies.</li>
<li>If the request includes topologyVersion without maxAwaitTimeMS or vice versa, return an error.</li>
<li>If the request omits topologyVersion and maxAwaitTimeMS, reply immediately.</li>
<li>If the request includes topologyVersion and maxAwaitTimeMS, then reply immediately if the server's
topologyVersion.processId does not match the request's, otherwise reply when the server's topologyVersion.counter is
greater than the request's, or maxAwaitTimeMS elapses, whichever comes first.</li>
<li>Following the <a href="../message/OP_MSG.html">OP_MSG spec</a>, if the request omits the exhaustAllowed flag, the server MUST NOT
set the moreToCome flag on the reply. If the request's exhaustAllowed flag is set, the server MAY set the moreToCome
flag on the reply. If the server sets moreToCome, it MUST continue streaming replies without awaiting further
requests. Between replies it MUST wait until the server's topologyVersion.counter is incremented or maxAwaitTimeMS
elapses, whichever comes first. If the reply includes <code>ok: 0</code> the server MUST NOT set the moreToCome flag.</li>
<li>On a topology change that changes the horizon parameters, the server will close all application connections.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="streaming-protocol"><a class="header" href="#streaming-protocol">Streaming Protocol</a></h3>
<p>The streaming protocol is used to monitor MongoDB 4.4+ servers and optimally reduces the time it takes for a client to
discover server state changes. Multi-threaded or asynchronous drivers MUST use the streaming protocol when connected to
a server that supports the awaitable hello or legacy hello commands. This protocol requires an extra thread and an extra
socket for each monitor to perform RTT calculations.</p>
<h4 id="streaming-disabled"><a class="header" href="#streaming-disabled">Streaming disabled</a></h4>
<p>The streaming protocol MUST be disabled when either:</p>
<ul>
<li>the client is configured with serverMonitoringMode=poll, or</li>
<li>the client is configured with serverMonitoringMode=auto and a FaaS platform is detected, or</li>
<li>the server does not support streaming (eg MongoDB &lt; 4.4).</li>
</ul>
<p>When the streaming protocol is disabled the client MUST use the <a href="#polling-protocol">polling protocol</a> and MUST NOT start
an extra thread or connection for <a href="#measuring-rtt">Measuring RTT</a>.</p>
<p>See
<a href="#why-disable-the-streaming-protocol-on-faas-platforms-like-aws-lambda">Why disable the streaming protocol on FaaS platforms like AWS Lambda?</a>.</p>
<h4 id="streaming-hello-or-legacy-hello"><a class="header" href="#streaming-hello-or-legacy-hello">Streaming hello or legacy hello</a></h4>
<p>The streaming hello or legacy hello protocol uses awaitable hello or legacy hello with the OP_MSG exhaustAllowed flag to
continuously stream hello or legacy hello responses from the server. Drivers MUST set the OP_MSG exhaustAllowed flag
with the awaitable hello or legacy hello command and MUST process each hello or legacy hello response. (I.e., they MUST
process responses strictly in the order they were received.)</p>
<p>A client follows these rules when processing the hello or legacy hello exhaust response:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the response indicates a command error, or a network error or timeout occurs, the client MUST close the connection
and restart the monitoring protocol on a new connection. (See
<a href="#network-or-command-error-during-server-check">Network or command error during server check</a>.)</li>
<li>If the response is successful (includes "ok:1") and includes the OP_MSG moreToCome flag, then the client begins
reading the next response.</li>
<li>If the response is successful (includes "ok:1") and does not include the OP_MSG moreToCome flag, then the client
initiates a new awaitable hello or legacy hello with the topologyVersion field from the previous response.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="socket-timeout"><a class="header" href="#socket-timeout">Socket timeout</a></h4>
<p>Clients MUST use connectTimeoutMS as the timeout for the connection handshake. When connectTimeoutMS=0, the timeout is
unlimited and MUST remain unlimited for awaitable hello and legacy hello replies. Otherwise, connectTimeoutMS is
non-zero and clients MUST use connectTimeoutMS + heartbeatFrequencyMS as the timeout for awaitable hello and legacy
hello replies.</p>
<h4 id="measuring-rtt"><a class="header" href="#measuring-rtt">Measuring RTT</a></h4>
<p>When using the streaming protocol, clients MUST issue a hello or legacy hello command to each server to measure RTT
every heartbeatFrequencyMS. The RTT command MUST be run on a dedicated connection to each server. Clients MUST NOT use
dedicated connections to measure RTT when the streaming protocol is not used. (See
<a href="#monitors-must-use-a-dedicated-connection-for-rtt-commands">Monitors MUST use a dedicated connection for RTT commands</a>.)</p>
<p>Clients MUST update the RTT from the hello or legacy hello duration of the initial connection handshake. Clients MUST
NOT update RTT based on streaming hello or legacy hello responses.</p>
<p>Clients MUST ignore the response to the hello or legacy hello command when measuring RTT. Errors encountered when
running a hello or legacy hello command MUST NOT update the topology. (See
<a href="#why-dont-clients-mark-a-server-unknown-when-an-rtt-command-fails">Why don't clients mark a server unknown when an RTT command fails?</a>)</p>
<p>Clients MUST track the minimum RTT out of the (at most) last 10 samples. Clients MUST report the minimum RTT as 0 until
at least 2 samples have been gathered.</p>
<p>When constructing a ServerDescription from a streaming hello or legacy hello response, clients MUST set the average and
minimum round trip times from the RTT task as the "roundTripTime" and "minRoundTripTime" fields, respectively.</p>
<p>See the pseudocode in the <a href="#rtt-thread">RTT thread</a> section for an example implementation.</p>
<h4 id="sdam-monitoring"><a class="header" href="#sdam-monitoring">SDAM Monitoring</a></h4>
<p>Clients MUST publish a ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent before attempting to read the next hello or legacy hello exhaust
response. (See
<a href="#why-must-streaming-hello-or-legacy-hello-clients-publish-serverheartbeatstartedevents">Why must streaming hello or legacy hello clients publish ServerHeartbeatStartedEvents?</a>)</p>
<p>Clients MUST NOT publish any events when running an RTT command. (See

<h4 id="heartbeat-frequency"><a class="header" href="#heartbeat-frequency">Heartbeat frequency</a></h4>
<p>In the polling protocol, a client sleeps between each hello or legacy hello check (for at least minHeartbeatFrequencyMS
and up to heartbeatFrequencyMS). In the streaming protocol, after processing an "ok:1" hello or legacy hello response,
the client MUST NOT sleep and MUST begin the next check immediately.</p>
<p>Clients MUST set <a href="#maxawaittimems">maxAwaitTimeMS</a> to heartbeatFrequencyMS.</p>
<h4 id="hello-or-legacy-hello-cancellation"><a class="header" href="#hello-or-legacy-hello-cancellation">hello or legacy hello Cancellation</a></h4>
<p>When a client is closed, clients MUST cancel all hello and legacy hello checks; a monitor blocked waiting for the next
streaming hello or legacy hello response MUST be interrupted such that threads may exit promptly without waiting
maxAwaitTimeMS.</p>
<p>When a client marks a server Unknown from
<a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring.html#network-error-when-reading-or-writing">Network error when reading or writing</a>,
clients MUST cancel the hello or legacy hello check on that server and close the current monitoring connection. (See

<h3 id="polling-protocol"><a class="header" href="#polling-protocol">Polling Protocol</a></h3>
<p>The polling protocol is used to monitor MongoDB &lt; 4.4 servers or when streaming is disabled. The client

<p>When a monitor completes a successful check against a server, it MUST mark the connection pool for that server as
"ready", and doing so MUST be synchronized with the update to the topology (e.g. by marking the pool as ready in
onServerDescriptionChanged). This is required to ensure a server does not get selected while its pool is still paused.

<p>When a server <a href="#check">check</a> fails due to a network error (including a network timeout) or a command error (<code>ok: 0</code>),
the client MUST follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close the current monitoring connection.</li>
<li>Mark the server Unknown.</li>
<li>Clear the connection pool for the server (See
<a href="#clear-the-connection-pool-on-both-network-and-command-errors">Clear the connection pool on both network and command errors</a>).

If this was a network timeout error, then the pool MUST be cleared with interruptInUseConnections = true (see

<p>The streaming hello or legacy hello protocol is optimal in terms of latency; clients are always blocked waiting for the
server to stream updated hello or legacy hello information, they learn of server state changes as soon as possible.
However, streaming hello or legacy hello has two downsides:</p>
<ol>
<li>Streaming hello or legacy hello requires a new connection to each server to calculate the RTT.</li>
<li>Streaming hello or legacy hello requires a new thread (or threads) to calculate the RTT of each server.</li>
</ol>
<p>To address these concerns we designed the alternating hello or legacy hello protocol. This protocol would have
alternated between awaitable hello or legacy hello and regular hello or legacy hello. The awaitable hello or legacy
hello replaces the polling protocol's client side sleep and allows the client to receive updated hello or legacy hello
responses sooner. The regular hello or legacy hello allows the client to maintain accurate RTT calculations without
requiring any extra threads or sockets.</p>
<p>We reject this design because streaming hello or legacy hello is strictly better at reducing the client's
time-to-recovery. We determined that one extra connection per server per MongoClient is reasonable for all drivers.
Applications that upgrade may see a modest increase in connections and memory usage on the server. We don't expect this
increase to be problematic; however, we have several projects planned for future MongoDB releases to make the streaming
hello or legacy hello protocol cheaper server-side which should mitigate the cost of the extra monitoring connections.</p>
<h3 id="use-tcp-smoothed-round-trip-time-instead-of-measuring-rtt-explicitly"><a class="header" href="#use-tcp-smoothed-round-trip-time-instead-of-measuring-rtt-explicitly">Use TCP smoothed round-trip time instead of measuring RTT explicitly</a></h3>
<p>TCP sockets internally maintain a "smoothed round-trip time" or SRTT. Drivers could use this SRTT instead of measuring
RTT explicitly via hello or legacy hello commands. The server could even include this value on all hello or legacy hello
responses. We reject this idea for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not all programming languages have an API to access the TCP socket's RTT.</li>
<li>On Windows, RTT access requires Admin privileges.</li>
<li>TCP's SRTT would likely differ substantially from RTT measurements in the current protocol. For example, the SRTT can
be reset on <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2988#section-5">retransmission timeouts</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rationale"><a class="header" href="#rationale">Rationale</a></h2>
<h3 id="thread-per-server"><a class="header" href="#thread-per-server">Thread per server</a></h3>
<p>Mongos uses a monitor thread per replica set, rather than a thread per server. A thread per server is impractical if
mongos is monitoring a large number of replica sets. But a driver only monitors one.</p>
<p>In mongos, threads trying to do reads and writes join the effort to scan the replica set. Such threads are more likely
to be abundant in mongos than in drivers, so mongos can rely on them to help with monitoring.</p>
<p>In short: mongos has different scaling concerns than a multi-threaded or asynchronous driver, so it allocates threads
differently.</p>
<h3 id="socket-timeout-for-monitoring-is-connecttimeoutms"><a class="header" href="#socket-timeout-for-monitoring-is-connecttimeoutms">Socket timeout for monitoring is connectTimeoutMS</a></h3>
<p>When a client waits for a server to respond to a connection, the client does not know if the server will respond
eventually or if it is down. Users can help the client guess correctly by supplying a reasonable connectTimeoutMS for
their network: on some networks a server is probably down if it hasn't responded in 10 ms, on others a server might
still be up even if it hasn't responded in 10 seconds.</p>
<p>The socketTimeoutMS, on the other hand, must account for both network latency and the operation's duration on the
server. Applications should typically set a very long or infinite socketTimeoutMS so they can wait for long-running
MongoDB operations.</p>
<p>Multi-threaded clients use distinct sockets for monitoring and for application operations. A socket used for monitoring
does two things: it connects and calls hello or legacy hello. Both operations are fast on the server, so only network
latency matters. Thus both operations SHOULD use connectTimeoutMS, since that is the value users supply to help the
client guess if a server is down, based on users' knowledge of expected latencies on their networks.</p>
<h3 id="a-monitor-should-not-use-the-clients-regular-connection-pool"><a class="header" href="#a-monitor-should-not-use-the-clients-regular-connection-pool">A monitor SHOULD NOT use the client's regular connection pool</a></h3>
<p>If a multi-threaded driver's connection pool enforces a maximum size and monitors use sockets from the pool, there are
two bad options: either monitors compete with the application for sockets, or monitors have the exceptional ability to
create sockets even when the pool has reached its maximum size. The former risks starving the monitor. The latter is
more complex than it is worth. (A lesson learned from PyMongo 2.6's pool, which implemented this option.)</p>
<p>Since this rule is justified for drivers that enforce a maximum pool size, this spec recommends that all drivers follow
the same rule for the sake of consistency.</p>
<h3 id="monitors-must-use-a-dedicated-connection-for-rtt-commands"><a class="header" href="#monitors-must-use-a-dedicated-connection-for-rtt-commands">Monitors MUST use a dedicated connection for RTT commands</a></h3>
<p>When using the streaming protocol, a monitor needs to maintain an extra dedicated connection to periodically update its
average round trip time in order to support <a href="../server-selection/server-selection.html#localthresholdms">localThresholdMS</a>
from the Server Selection spec.</p>
<p>It could pop a connection from its regular pool, but we rejected this option for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under contention the RTT task may block application operations from completing in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Under contention the application may block the RTT task from completing in a timely manner.</li>
<li>Under contention the RTT task may often result in an extra connection anyway because the pool creates new connections
under contention up to maxPoolSize.</li>
<li>This would be inconsistent with the rule that a monitor SHOULD NOT use the client's regular connection pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>The client could open and close a new connection for each RTT check. We rejected this design, because if we ping every
heartbeatFrequencyMS (default 10 seconds) then the cost to the client and the server of creating and destroying the
connection might exceed the cost of keeping a dedicated connection open.</p>
<p>Instead, the client must use a dedicated connection reserved for RTT commands. Despite the cost of the additional
connection per server, we chose this option as the safest and least likely to result in surprising behavior under load.</p>
<h3 id="monitors-must-use-the-hello-or-legacy-hello-command-to-measure-rtt"><a class="header" href="#monitors-must-use-the-hello-or-legacy-hello-command-to-measure-rtt">Monitors MUST use the hello or legacy hello command to measure RTT</a></h3>
<p>In the streaming protocol, clients could use the "ping", "hello", or legacy hello commands to measure RTT. This spec
chooses "hello" or legacy hello for consistency with the polling protocol as well as consistency with the initial RTT
provided the connection handshake which also uses the hello or legacy hello commands. Additionally, mongocryptd does not
allow the ping command but does allow hello or legacy hello.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-use-awaitedtimems-in-the-server-response-to-calculate-rtt-in-the-streaming-protocol"><a class="header" href="#why-not-use-awaitedtimems-in-the-server-response-to-calculate-rtt-in-the-streaming-protocol">Why not use <code>awaitedTimeMS</code> in the server response to calculate RTT in the streaming protocol?</a></h3>
<p>One approach to calculating RTT in the streaming protocol would be to have the server return an <code>awaitedTimeMS</code> in its
<code>hello</code> or legacy hello response. A driver could then determine the RTT by calculating the difference between the
initial request, or last response, and the <code>awaitedTimeMS</code>.</p>
<p>We rejected this design because of a number of issue with the unreliability of clocks in distributed systems. Clocks
skew between local and remote system clocks. This approach mixes two notions of time: the local clock times the whole
operation while the remote clock times the wait. This means that if these clocks tick at different rates, or there are
anomalies like clock changes, you will get bad results. To make matters worse, you will be comparing times from multiple
servers that could each have clocks ticking at different rates. This approach will bias toward servers with the fastest
ticking clock, since it will seem like it spends the least time on the wire.</p>
<p>Additionally, systems using NTP will experience clock "slew". ntpd "slews" time by up to 500 parts-per-million to have
the local time gradually approach the "true" time without big jumps - over a 10 second window that means a 5ms
difference. If both sides are slewing in opposite directions, that can result in an effective difference of 10ms. Both
of these times are close enough to <a href="../server-selection/server-selection.html#localthresholdms">localThresholdMS</a> to
significantly affect which servers are viable in NEAREST calculations.</p>
<p>Ensuring that all measurements use the same clock obviates the need for a more complicated solution, and mitigates the
above mentioned concerns.</p>
<h3 id="why-dont-clients-mark-a-server-unknown-when-an-rtt-command-fails"><a class="header" href="#why-dont-clients-mark-a-server-unknown-when-an-rtt-command-fails">Why don't clients mark a server unknown when an RTT command fails?</a></h3>
<p>In the streaming protocol, clients use the hello or legacy hello command on a dedicated connection to measure a server's
RTT. However, errors encountered when running the RTT command MUST NOT mark a server Unknown. We reached this decision
because the dedicated RTT connection does not come from a connection pool and thus does not have a generation number
associated with it. Without a generation number we cannot handle errors from the RTT command without introducing race
conditions. Introducing such a generation number would add complexity to this design without much benefit. It is safe to
ignore these errors because the Monitor will soon discover the server's state regardless (either through an updated
streaming response, an error on the streaming connection, or by handling an error on an application connection).</p>
<h3 id="drivers-cancel-in-progress-monitor-checks"><a class="header" href="#drivers-cancel-in-progress-monitor-checks">Drivers cancel in-progress monitor checks</a></h3>
<p>When an application operation fails with a non-timeout network error, drivers cancel that monitor's in-progress check.</p>
<p>We assume that a non-timeout network error on one application connection implies that all other connections to that
server are also bad. This means that it is redundant to continue reading on the current monitoring connection. Instead,
we cancel the current monitor check, close the monitoring connection, and start a new check soon. Note that we rely on
the connection/pool generation number checking to avoid races and ensure that the monitoring connection is only closed
once.</p>
<p>This approach also handles the rare case where the client sees a network error on an application connection but the
monitoring connection is still healthy. If we did not cancel the monitor check in this scenario, then the server would
remain in the Unknown state until the next hello or legacy hello response (up to maxAwaitTimeMS). A potential real world
example of this behavior is when Azure closes an idle connection in the application pool.</p>
<h3 id="retry-hello-or-legacy-hello-calls-once"><a class="header" href="#retry-hello-or-legacy-hello-calls-once">Retry hello or legacy hello calls once</a></h3>
<p>A monitor's connection to a server is long-lived and used only for hello or legacy hello calls. So if a server has
responded in the past, a network error on the monitor's connection means that there was a network glitch, or a server
restart since the last check, or that the server is truly down. To handle the case that the server is truly down, the
monitor makes the server unselectable by marking it Unknown. To handle the case of a transient network glitch or
restart, the monitor immediately runs the next check without waiting.</p>
<h3 id="clear-the-connection-pool-on-both-network-and-command-errors"><a class="header" href="#clear-the-connection-pool-on-both-network-and-command-errors">Clear the connection pool on both network and command errors</a></h3>
<p>A monitor clears the connection pool when a server check fails with a network or command error
(<a href="#network-or-command-error-during-server-check">Network or command error during server check</a>). When the check fails
with a network error it is likely that all connections to that server are also closed. (See
<a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/JAVA-1252">JAVA-1252</a>). When the check fails with a network timeout error, a monitor
MUST set interruptInUseConnections to true. See,
<a href="../connection-monitoring-and-pooling/connection-monitoring-and-pooling.html#why-does-the-pool-need-to-support-interrupting-in-use-connections-as-part-of-its-clear-logic">Why does the pool need to support closing in use connections as part of its clear logic?</a>.</p>
<p>When the server is shutting down, it may respond to hello or legacy hello commands with ShutdownInProgress errors before
closing connections. In this case, the monitor clears the connection pool because all connections will be closed soon.
Other command errors are unexpected but are handled identically.</p>

<p>The <a href="server-discovery-and-monitoring-logging-and-monitoring.html#heartbeats">SDAM Monitoring spec</a> guarantees that every
ServerHeartbeatStartedEvent has either a correlating ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvent or ServerHeartbeatFailedEvent. This
is consistent with Command Monitoring on exhaust cursors where the driver publishes a fake CommandStartedEvent before
reading the next getMore response.</p>

<p>In the streaming protocol, clients MUST NOT publish any events (server, topology, command, CMAP, etc..) when running an
RTT command. We considered introducing new RTT events (ServerRTTStartedEvent, ServerRTTSucceededEvent,
ServerRTTFailedEvent) but it's not clear that there is a demand for this. Applications can still monitor changes to a
server's RTT by listening to TopologyDescriptionChangedEvents.</p>

<p>ServerHeartbeatSucceededEvents published from awaitable hello or legacy hello responses will regularly have 10 second
durations. The spec introduces the "awaited" field on server heartbeat events so that applications can differentiate a
slow heartbeat in the polling protocol from a normal awaitable hello or legacy hello heartbeat in the new protocol.</p>

<p>The streaming protocol relies on the assumption that the client can read the server's heartbeat responses in a timely
manner, otherwise the client will be acting on stale information. In many FaaS platforms, like AWS Lambda, host
applications will be suspended and resumed many minutes later. This behavior causes a build up of heartbeat responses
and the client can end up spending a long time in a catch up phase processing outdated responses. This problem was
discovered in <a href="https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DRIVERS-2246">DRIVERS-2246</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the streaming protocol requires an extra connection and thread per monitored server which is expensive on
platforms like AWS Lambda. The extra connection is particularly inefficient when thousands of AWS instances and thus
thousands of clients are used.</p>
<p>We decided to make polling the default behavior when running on FaaS platforms like AWS Lambda to improve scalability,
performance, and reliability.</p>
<h3 id="why-introduce-a-knob-for-servermonitoringmode"><a class="header" href="#why-introduce-a-knob-for-servermonitoringmode">Why introduce a knob for serverMonitoringMode?</a></h3>
<p>The serverMonitoringMode knob provides a workaround in cases where the polling protocol would be a better choice but the
driver is not running on a FaaS platform. It also provides a workaround in case the FaaS detection logic becomes
outdated or inaccurate.</p>

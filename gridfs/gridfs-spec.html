<p>GridFS is a convention drivers use to store and retrieve BSON binary data (type "x05") that exceeds MongoDB"s
BSON-document size limit of 16 MiB. When this data, called a <strong>user file</strong>, is written to the system, GridFS divides the
file into <strong>chunks</strong> that are stored as distinct documents in a <strong>chunks collection</strong>. To retrieve a stored file, GridFS
locates and returns all of its component chunks. Internally, GridFS creates a <strong>files collection document</strong> for each
stored file. Files collection documents hold information about stored files, and they are stored in a <strong>files
collection</strong>.</p>
<p>This spec defines a basic API for GridFS. This spec also outlines advanced GridFS features that drivers can choose to
support in their implementations. Additionally, this document attempts to clarify the meaning and purpose of all fields
in the GridFS data model, disambiguate GridFS terminology, and document configuration options that were previously
unspecified.</p>

<p><strong>Bucket name</strong></p>
<p>A prefix under which a GridFS system"s collections are stored. Collection names for the files and chunks collections are
prefixed with the bucket name. The bucket name MUST be configurable by the user. Multiple buckets may exist within a
single database. The default bucket name is "fs".</p>
<p><strong>Chunk</strong></p>
<p>A section of a user file, stored as a single document in the "chunks" collection of a GridFS bucket. The default size
for the data field in chunks is 255 KiB. Chunk documents have the following form:</p>

<p><strong>_id</strong></p>
<p>a unique ID for this document of type BSON ObjectId</p>
<p><strong>files_id</strong></p>
<p>the id for this file (the <code>_id</code> from the files collection document). This field takes the type of the corresponding

<p>A collection in which chunks of a user file are stored. The name for this collection is the word 'chunks' prefixed by
the bucket name. The default is "fs.chunks".</p>
<p><strong>Empty chunk</strong></p>
<p>A chunk with a zero length "data" field.</p>
<p><strong>Files collection</strong></p>
<p>A collection in which information about stored files is stored. There will be one files collection document per stored
file. The name for this collection is the word "files" prefixed by the bucket name. The default is "fs.files".</p>
<p><strong>Files collection document</strong></p>
<p>A document stored in the files collection that contains information about a single stored file. Files collection
documents have the following form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{

  "aliases" : &lt;string array&gt;,
  "metadata" : &lt;Document&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>_id</strong></p>
<p>a unique ID for this document. Usually this will be of type ObjectId, but a custom <code>_id</code> value provided by the
application may be of any type.</p>
<p><strong>length</strong></p>
<p>the length of this stored file, in bytes</p>
<p><strong>chunkSize</strong></p>
<p>the size, in bytes, of each data chunk of this file. This value is configurable by file. The default is 255 KiB.</p>
<p><strong>uploadDate</strong></p>
<p>the date and time this file was added to GridFS, stored as a BSON datetime value. The value of this field MUST be the
datetime when the upload completed, not the datetime when it was begun.</p>
<p><strong>md5</strong></p>
<p>DEPRECATED, a hash of the contents of the stored file</p>
<p><strong>filename</strong></p>
<p>the name of this stored file; this does not need to be unique</p>

<p>DEPRECATED, any MIME type, for application use only</p>
<p><strong>aliases</strong></p>
<p>DEPRECATED, for application use only</p>
<p><strong>metadata</strong></p>
<p>any additional application data the user wishes to store</p>
<p>Note: some older versions of GridFS implementations allowed applications to add arbitrary fields to the files collection
document at the root level. New implementations of GridFS will not allow this, but must be prepared to handle existing
files collection documents that might have additional fields.</p>
<p>Note: drivers SHOULD store length as Int64 and chunkSize as Int32 when creating new GridFS files. However, drivers MUST
be able to handle existing GridFS files where the length and chunkSize fields might have been stored using a different
numeric data type.</p>
<p><strong>Orphaned chunk</strong></p>
<p>A document in the chunks collections for which the "files_id" does not match any <code>_id</code> in the files collection. Orphaned
chunks may be created if write or delete operations on GridFS fail part-way through.</p>
<p><strong>Stored File</strong></p>
<p>A user file that has been stored in GridFS, consisting of a files collection document in the files collection and zero
or more documents in the chunks collection.</p>
<p><strong>Stream</strong></p>
<p>An abstraction that represents streamed I/O. In some languages a different word is used to represent this abstraction.</p>
<p><strong>TFileId</strong></p>
<p>While GridFS file id values are ObjectIds by default, an application may choose to use custom file id values, which may
be of any type. In this spec the term TFileId refers to whatever data type is appropriate in the driver's programming
language to represent a file id. This would be something like object, BsonValue or a generic <code>&lt;TFileId&gt;</code> type parameter.</p>
<p><strong>User File</strong></p>
<p>A data added by a user to GridFS. This data may map to an actual file on disk, a stream of input, a large data object,

<p>GridFSBucket objects MUST allow the following options to be configurable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>bucketName:</strong> the name of this GridFS bucket. The files and chunks collection for this GridFS bucket are prefixed by
this name followed by a dot. Defaults to "fs". This allows multiple GridFS buckets, each with a unique name, to exist
within the same database.</li>
<li><strong>chunkSizeBytes:</strong> the number of bytes stored in chunks for new user files added through this GridFSBucket object.
This will not reformat existing files in the system that use a different chunk size. Defaults to 255 KiB.</li>

<li><strong>disableMD5:</strong> this allows users to disable MD5 when operating under FIPS restrictions. It is provided to allow a

Following a driver's normal feature removal cycle, when MD5 support is removed, this option MUST be removed or
otherwise made into a no-op option.</li>

<p>GridFSBucket instances are immutable. Their properties MUST NOT be changed after the instance has been created. If your
driver provides a fluent way to provide new values for properties, these fluent methods MUST return new instances of
GridFSBucket.</p>
<h3 id="indexes"><a class="header" href="#indexes">Indexes</a></h3>
<p>For efficient execution of various GridFS operations the following indexes MUST exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>an index on { filename : 1, uploadDate : 1 } on the files collection</li>
<li>a unique index on { files_id : 1, n : 1 } on the chunks collection</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally we leave it up to the user to create whatever indexes they see fit, but because GridFS is likely to be looked
at as a black box we should create these indexes automatically in a way that involves the least amount of overhead
possible.</p>
<h4 id="before-read-operations"><a class="header" href="#before-read-operations">Before read operations</a></h4>
<p>For read operations, drivers MUST assume that the proper indexes exist.</p>
<h4 id="before-write-operations"><a class="header" href="#before-write-operations">Before write operations</a></h4>
<p>Immediately before the <strong>first</strong> write operation on an instance of a GridFSBucket class is attempted (and not earlier),
drivers MUST:</p>
<ul>
<li>determine if the files collection is empty using the primary read preference mode.</li>
<li>and if so, create the indexes described above if they do not already exist</li>
</ul>
<p>To determine whether the files collection is empty drivers SHOULD execute the equivalent of the following shell command:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>db.fs.files.findOne({}, { _id : 1 })</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>If no document is returned the files collection is empty.</p>
<p>This method of determining whether the files collection is empty should perform better than checking the count in the
case where the files collection is sharded.</p>
<p>Drivers MUST check whether the indexes already exist before attempting to create them. This supports the scenario where
an application is running with read-only authorizations.</p>
<p>When checking whether an index exists drivers MUST compare numeric values by value even when they are of different
types, because the actual type will depend on how the index was created (for example, indexes created using the shell
will have double as the type for numeric values).</p>
<p>For example, the following index specifications should all be treated as equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li>{ filename : 1, uploadDate : 1 } // where 1 is either a 32-bit or 64-bit integer</li>
<li>{ filename : 1, uploadDate : 1.0 }</li>
<li>{ filename : 1.0, uploadDate : 1 }</li>
<li>{ filename : 1.0, uploadDate : 1.0 }</li>
</ul>
<p>If a driver determines that it should create the indexes, it MUST raise an error if the attempt to create the indexes
fails.</p>
<p>Drivers MUST create the indexes in foreground mode.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Uploads a user file to a GridFS bucket. For languages that have a Stream abstraction, drivers SHOULD use that Stream
abstraction. For languages that do not have a Stream abstraction, drivers MUST create an abstraction that supports
streaming.</p>
<p>In the case of open_upload_stream, the driver returns a Stream to which the application will write the contents of the
file. As the application writes the contents to the returned Stream, the contents are uploaded as chunks in the chunks
collection. When the application signals it is done writing the contents of the file by calling close (or its
equivalent) on the returned Stream, a files collection document is created in the files collection. Once the Stream has
been closed (and the files collection document has been created) a driver MUST NOT allow further writes to the upload
Stream.</p>
<p>The driver MUST make the Id of the new file available to the caller. Typically a driver SHOULD make the Id available as
a property named Id on the Stream that is returned. In languages where that is not idiomatic, a driver MUST make the Id
available in a way that is appropriate for that language.</p>
<p>In the case of upload_from_stream, the driver reads the contents of the user file by consuming the the source Stream
until end of file is reached. The driver does NOT close the source Stream.</p>
<p>Drivers MUST take an "options" document with configurable parameters. Drivers for dynamic languages MUST ignore any
unrecognized fields in the options for this method (this does not apply to drivers for static languages which define an
Options class that by definition only contains valid fields).</p>
<p>Note that in GridFS, "filename" is not a unique identifier. There may be many stored files with the same filename stored
in a GridFS bucket under different ids. Multiple stored files with the same filename are called 'revisions', and the
'uploadDate' is used to distinguish newer revisions from older ones.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation details:</strong></p>
<p>If "chunkSizeBytes" is set through the options, that value MUST be used as the chunk size for this stored file. If this
parameter is not specified, the default chunkSizeBytes setting for this GridFSBucket object MUST be used instead.</p>
<p>To store a user file, the file must have a unique id. In some cases the driver can generate a unique ObjectId to serve
as the id for the file being uploaded. Otherwise the application provides the value. Drivers store the contents of the
user file in the chunks collection by breaking up the contents into chunks of size "chunkSizeBytes". For a non-empty
user file, for each n<sup>th</sup> section of the file, drivers create a chunk document and set its fields as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Files_id: the id generated for this stored file.</li>
<li>N: this is the n<sup>th</sup> section of the stored file, zero based.</li>
<li>Data: a section of file data, stored as BSON binary data with subtype 0x00. All chunks except the last one must be
exactly 'chunkSizeBytes' long. The last chunk can be smaller, and should only be as large as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Historically, while streaming the user file, drivers computed an MD5 digest for the (now deprecated) 'md5' field of the
files collection document. If drivers preserve this behavior for backwards compatibility, they MUST provide the
'disableMD5' member of GridFSBucketOptions. When 'disableMD5' is true, drivers MUST NOT compute an MD5 digest or include
it in the files collection document. If drivers no longer support the deprecated 'md5' field, they MUST NOT provide the
'disableMD5' member (or it MUST be a no-op) and MUST NOT compute MD5.</p>
<p>After storing all chunk documents generated for the user file in the "chunks" collection, drivers create a files
collection document for the file and store it in the files collection. The fields in the files collection document are
set as follows:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>length</td><td>the length of this stored file, in bytes.</td></tr>
<tr><td>chunksize</td><td>the chunk size in bytes used to break the user file into chunks. While the configuration option is named "chunkSizeBytes" for clarity, for legacy reasons, the files collection document uses only "chunkSize".</td></tr>
<tr><td>uploaddate</td><td>a BSON datetime object for the current time, in UTC, when the files collection document was created.</td></tr>
<tr><td>md5</td><td>MD5 checksum for this user file, computed from the file's data, stored as a hex string, if computed, otherwise omitted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>filename</td><td>the filename passed to this function, UTF-8 encoded.</td></tr>
<tr><td>contenttype</td><td>the "contentType" passed in the options, if provided; otherwise omitted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>aliases</td><td>the array passed in the options, if provided; otherwise omitted.</td></tr>
<tr><td>metadata</td><td>the "metadata" document passed in the options, if provided; otherwise omitted.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>If a user file contains no data, drivers MUST still create a files collection document for it with length set to zero.
Drivers MUST NOT create any empty chunks for this file.</p>
<p>Drivers MUST NOT run the 'filemd5' database command to confirm that all chunks were successfully uploaded. We assume
that if none of the inserts failed then the chunks must have been successfully inserted, and running the 'filemd5'
command would just be unnecessary overhead and doesn't work for sharded chunk keys anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Operation Failure</strong></p>
<p>If any of the above operations fail against the server, drivers MUST raise an error. If some inserts succeeded before
the failed operation, these become orphaned chunks. Drivers MUST NOT attempt to clean up these orphaned chunks. The
rationale is that whatever failure caused the orphan chunks will most likely also prevent cleaning up the orphaned
chunks, and any attempts to clean up the orphaned chunks will simply cause long delays before reporting the original
failure to the application.</p>
<p><strong>Aborting an upload</strong></p>
<p>Drivers SHOULD provide a mechanism to abort an upload. When using open_upload_stream, the returned Stream SHOULD have an
Abort method. When using upload_from_stream, the upload will be aborted if the source stream raises an error.</p>
<p>When an upload is aborted any chunks already uploaded MUST be deleted. Note that this differs from the case where an
attempt to insert a chunk fails, in which case drivers immediately report the failure without attempting to delete any
chunks already uploaded.</p>
<p>Abort MUST raise an error if it is unable to successfully abort the upload (for example, if an error occurs while
deleting any chunks already uploaded). However, if the upload is being aborted because the source stream provided to
upload_from_stream raised an error then the original error should be re-raised.</p>
<p>Abort MUST also close the Stream, or at least place it in an aborted state, so any further attempts to write additional
content to the Stream after Abort has been called fail immediately.</p>

Stream abstraction. For languages that do not have a Stream abstraction, drivers MUST create an abstraction that
supports streaming.</p>
<p>In the case of open_download_stream, the application reads the contents of the stored file by reading from the returned
Stream until end of file is reached. The application MUST call close (or its equivalent) on the returned Stream when it
is done reading the contents.</p>
<p>In the case of download_to_stream the driver writes the contents of the stored file to the provided Stream. The driver
does NOT call close (or its equivalent) on the Stream.</p>
<p>Note: By default a file id is of type ObjectId. If an application uses custom file ids it may be of any type.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation details:</strong></p>
<p>Drivers must first retrieve the files collection document for this file. If there is no files collection document, the
file either never existed, is in the process of being deleted, or has been corrupted, and the driver MUST raise an
error.</p>
<p>Then, implementers retrieve all chunks with files_id equal to id, sorted in ascending order on "n".</p>
<p>However, when downloading a zero length stored file the driver MUST NOT issue a query against the chunks collection,
since that query is not necessary. For a zero length file, drivers return either an empty stream or send nothing to the
provided stream (depending on the download method).</p>
<p>If a networking error or server error occurs, drivers MUST raise an error.</p>
<p>As drivers stream the stored file they MUST check that each chunk received is the next expected chunk (i.e. it has the
expected "n" value) and that the data field is of the expected length. In the case of open_download_stream, if the
application stops reading from the stream before reaching the end of the stored file, any errors that might exist beyond
the point at which the application stopped reading won't be detected by the driver.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation details:</strong></p>
<p>There is an inherent race condition between the chunks and files collections. Without some transaction-like behavior
between these two collections, it is always possible for one client to delete a stored file while another client is
attempting a read of the stored file. For example, imagine client A retrieves a stored file"s files collection document,
client B deletes the stored file, then client A attempts to read the stored file"s chunks. Client A wouldn"t find any
chunks for the given stored file. To minimize the window of vulnerability of reading a stored file that is the process
of being deleted, drivers MUST first delete the files collection document for a stored file, then delete its associated
chunks.</p>
<p>If there is no such file listed in the files collection, drivers MUST raise an error. Drivers MAY attempt to delete any
orphaned chunks with files_id equal to id before raising the error.</p>

<p>Drivers MUST select the files collection document of the file to-be-returned by running a query on the files collection

<h3 id="partial-file-retrieval"><a class="header" href="#partial-file-retrieval">Partial File Retrieval</a></h3>
<p>In the case of open_download_stream, drivers SHOULD support partial file retrieval by allowing the application to read
only part of the stream. If a driver does support reading only part of the stream, it MUST do so using the standard
stream methods of its language for seeking to a position in a stream and reading the desired amount of data from that
position. This is the preferred method of supporting partial file retrieval.</p>
<p>In the case of download_to_stream, drivers are not required to support partial file retrieval. If they choose to do so,
drivers can support this operation by adding "start" and "end" to their supported options for download_to_stream. These
values represent non-negative byte offsets from the beginning of the file. When "start" and "end" are specified, drivers
return the bytes of the file in <code>[start, end)</code>. If "start" and "end" are equal no data is returned.</p>
<p>If either "start" or "end" is invalid, drivers MUST raise an error. These values are considered invalid if they are
negative, greater than the file length, or if "start" is greater than "end".</p>
<p>When performing partial reads, drivers SHOULD use the file"s "chunkSize" to calculate which chunks contain the desired
section and avoid reading unneeded documents from the "chunks" collection.</p>

<p>TBD</p>
<h2 id="motivation-for-change"><a class="header" href="#motivation-for-change">Motivation for Change</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/">existing GridFS documentation</a> is only concerned with the
underlying data model for this feature, and does not specify what basic set of features an implementation of GridFS
should or should not provide. As a result, GridFS is currently implemented across drivers, but with varying APIs,
features, and behavior guarantees. Current implementations also may not conform to the existing documentation.</p>
<p>This spec documents minimal operations required by all drivers offering GridFS support, along with optional features
that drivers may choose to support. This spec is also explicit about what features/behaviors of GridFS are not specified
and should not be supported. Additionally, this spec validates and clarifies the existing data model, deprecating fields
that are undesirable or incorrect.</p>
<h2 id="design-rationale"><a class="header" href="#design-rationale">Design Rationale</a></h2>
<p>Why is the default chunk size 255 KiB?</p>
<p>On MMAPv1, the server provides documents with extra padding to allow for in-place updates. When the "data" field of a
chunk is limited to 255 KiB, it ensures that the whole chunk document (the chunk data along with an <code>_id</code> and other
information) will fit into a 256 KiB section of memory, making the best use of the provided padding. Users setting
custom chunk sizes are advised not to use round power-of-two values, as the whole chunk document is likely to exceed
that space and demand extra padding from the system. WiredTiger handles its memory differently, and this optimization
does not apply. However, because application code generally won"t know what storage engine will be used in the database,
always avoiding round power-of-two chunk sizes is recommended.</p>
<p>Why can"t I alter documents once they are in the system?</p>
<p>GridFS works with documents stored in multiple collections within MongoDB. Because there is currently no way to
atomically perform operations across collections in MongoDB, there is no way to alter stored files in a way that
prevents race conditions between GridFS clients. Updating GridFS stored files without that server functionality would
involve a data model that could support this type of concurrency, and changing the GridFS data model is outside of the
scope of this spec.</p>
<p>Why provide a "rename" method?</p>
<p>By providing users with a reasonable alternative for renaming a file, we can discourage users from writing directly to
the files collections under GridFS. With this approach we can prevent critical files collection documents fields from
being mistakenly altered.</p>
<p>Why is there no way to perform arbitrary updates on the files collection?</p>
<p>The rename helper defined in this spec allows users to easily rename a stored file. While updating files collection
documents in other, more granular ways might be helpful for some users, validating such updates to ensure that other
files collection document fields remain protected is a complicated task. We leave the decision of how best to provide
this functionality to a future spec.</p>
<p>What is the "md5" field of a files collection document and how was it used?</p>
<p>"md5" holds an MD5 checksum that is computed from the original contents of a user file. Historically, GridFS did not use
acknowledged writes, so this checksum was necessary to ensure that writes went through properly. With acknowledged
writes, the MD5 checksum is still useful to ensure that files in GridFS have not been corrupted. A third party directly
accessing the 'files' and "chunks" collections under GridFS could, inadvertently or maliciously, make changes to
documents that would make them unusable by GridFS. Comparing the MD5 in the files collection document to a re-computed
MD5 allows detecting such errors and corruption. However, drivers now assume that the stored file is not corrupted, and
applications that want to use the MD5 value to check for corruption must do so themselves.</p>
<p>Why store the MD5 checksum instead of creating the hash as-needed?</p>
<p>The MD5 checksum must be computed when a file is initially uploaded to GridFS, as this is the only time we are
guaranteed to have the entire uncorrupted file. Computing it on-the-fly as a file is read from GridFS would ensure that
our reads were successful, but guarantees nothing about the state of the file in the system. A successful check against
the stored MD5 checksum guarantees that the stored file matches the original and no corruption has occurred.</p>
<p>Why are MD5 checksums now deprecated? What should users do instead?</p>
<p>MD5 is prohibited by FIPS 140-2. Operating systems and libraries operating in FIPS mode do not provide the MD5
algorithm. To avoid a broken GridFS feature on such systems, the use of MD5 with GridFS is deprecated, should not be
added to new implementations, and should be removed from existing implementations according to the deprecation policy of
individual drivers. Applications that desire a file digest should implement it outside of GridFS and store it with other
file metadata.</p>
<p>Why do drivers no longer need to call the filemd5 command on upload?</p>
<p>When a chunk is inserted and no error occurs the application can assume that the chunk was correctly inserted. No other
operations that insert or modify data require the driver to double check that the operation succeeded. It can be assumed
that any errors would have been detected by use of the appropriate write concern. Using filemd5 also prevents users from
sharding chunk keys.</p>
<p>What about write concern?</p>
<p>This spec leaves the choice of how to set write concern to driver authors. Implementers may choose to accept write
concern through options on the given methods, to set a configurable write concern on the GridFS object, to enforce a
single write concern for all GridFS operations, or to do something different.</p>
<p>If a user has given GridFS a write concern of 0, should we perform MD5 calculations? (If supported for backwards
compatibility)</p>
<p>Yes, because the checksum is used for detecting future corruption or misuse of GridFS collections.</p>
<p>Is GridFS limited by sharded systems?</p>
<p>For best performance, clients using GridFS on a sharded system should use a shard key that ensures all chunks for a
given stored file are routed to the same shard. Therefore, if the chunks collection is sharded, you should shard on the
files_id. Normally only the chunks collection benefits from sharding, since the files collection is usually small.
Otherwise, there are no limitations to GridFS on sharded systems.</p>
<p>Why is contentType deprecated?</p>
<p>Most fields in the files collection document are directly used by the driver, with the exception of: metadata,
contentType and aliases. All information that is purely for use of the application should be embedded in the 'metadata'
document. Users of GridFS who would like to store a contentType for use in their applications are encouraged to add a
'contentType' field to the "metadata" document instead of using the deprecated top-level "contentType" field.</p>
<p>Why are aliases deprecated?</p>
<p>The "aliases" field of the files collection documents was misleading. It implies that a file in GridFS could be accessed
by alternate names when, in fact, none of the existing implementations offer this functionality. For GridFS
implementations that retrieve stored files by filename or support specifying specific revisions of a stored file, it is
unclear how "aliases" should be interpreted. Users of GridFS who would like to store alternate filenames for use in
their applications are encouraged to add an "aliases" field to the "metadata" document instead of using the deprecated
top-level "aliases" field.</p>
<p>What happened to the put and get methods from earlier drafts?</p>
<p>Upload and download are more idiomatic names that more clearly indicate their purpose. Get and put are often associated
with getting and setting properties of a class, and using them instead of download and upload was confusing.</p>
<p>Why aren't there methods to upload and download byte arrays?</p>
<p>We assume that GridFS files are usually quite large and therefore that the GridFS API must support streaming. Most
languages have easy ways to wrap a stream around a byte array. Drivers are free to add helper methods that directly
support uploading and downloading GridFS files as byte arrays.</p>
<p>Should drivers report an error if a stored file has extra chunks?</p>
<p>The length and the chunkSize fields of the files collection document together imply exactly how many chunks a stored
file should have. If the chunks collection has any extra chunks the stored file is in an inconsistent state. Ideally we
would like to report that as an error, but this is an extremely unlikely state and we don't want to pay a performance
penalty checking for an error that is almost never there. Therefore, drivers MAY ignore extra chunks.</p>
<p>Why have we changed our mind about requiring the file id to be an ObjectId?</p>
<p>This spec originally required the file id for all new GridFS files to be an ObjectId and specified that the driver
itself would be the one to generate the ObjectId when a new file was uploaded. While this sounded like a good idea, it
has since become evident that there are valid use cases for an application to want to generate its own file id, and that
an application wouldn't necessarily want to use ObjectId as the type of the file id. The most common case where an
application would want to use a custom file id is when the chunks collection is to be sharded and the application wants
to use a custom file id that is suitable for sharding. Accordingly, we have relaxed this spec to allow an application to
supply a custom file id (of any type) when uploading a new file.</p>
<p>How can we maintain backward compatibility while supporting custom file ids?</p>
<p>For most methods supporting custom file ids is as simple as relaxing the type of the id parameter from ObjectId to
something more general like object or BSON value (or to a type parameter like <code>&lt;TFileId&gt;</code> in languages that support
generic methods). In a few cases new methods were added to support custom file ids. The original upload_from_stream
method returned an ObjectId, and support for custom file ids is implemented by adding a new method that takes the custom
file id as an additional parameter. Drivers should continue to support the original method if possible to maintain
backward compatibility. This spec does not attempt to completely mandate how each driver should maintain backward
compatibility, as different languages have different approaches and capabilities for maintaining backward compatibility.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility"><a class="header" href="#backwards-compatibility">Backwards Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>This spec presents a new API for GridFS systems, which may break existing functionality for some drivers. The following
are suggestions for ways to mitigate these incompatibilities.</p>
<p>File revisions</p>
<p>This document presents a basic API that does not support specifying specific revisions of a stored file, and an advanced
API that does. Drivers MAY choose to implement whichever API is closest to the functionality they now support. Note that
the methods for file insertion are the same whether specifying specific revisions is supported or not.</p>
<p>Method names</p>
<p>If drivers provide methods that conform to the functionality outlined in this document, drivers MAY continue to provide
those methods under their existing names. In this case, drivers SHOULD make it clear in their documentation that these
methods have equivalents defined in the spec under a different name.</p>
<p>ContentType field</p>
<p>Drivers MAY continue to create a "contentType'" field within files collection documents, so that applications depending
on this field continue to work. However, drivers SHOULD make it clear in their documentation that this field is
deprecated, and is not used at all in driver code. Documentation SHOULD encourage users to store contentType in the
"metadata" document instead.</p>
<p>Aliases field</p>
<p>Drivers MAY continue to create an "aliases" field within files collection documents, so that applications depending on
this field continue to work. However, drivers SHOULD make it clear in their documentation that this field is deprecated,
and is not used at all in driver code. Documentation SHOULD encourage users to store aliases in the "metadata" document
instead.</p>

<h2 id="future-work"><a class="header" href="#future-work">Future work</a></h2>
<p>Changes to the GridFS data model are out-of-scope for this spec, but may be considered for the future.</p>
<p>The ability to alter or append to existing GridFS files has been cited as something that would greatly improve the
system. While this functionality is not in-scope for this spec (see "Why can"t I alter documents once they are in the
system?") it is a potential area of growth for the future.</p>
